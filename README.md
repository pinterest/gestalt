[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/2c6b6e9f79054095354cc061876e4885f4b9212e1dbebda270.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/pinterest/gestalt)

Gestalt is a set of React UI components that enforces Pinterestâ€™s design language. We use it to streamline communication between designers and developers by enforcing a bunch of fundamental UI components. This common set of components helps raise the bar for UX & accessibility across Pinterest.

[Check out the Gestalt playground](https://codesandbox.io/s/k5plvp9v8v)

## Usage

Gestalt exports each component as ES6 modules and a single, precompiled CSS file:

```js
import { Text } from 'gestalt';
import 'gestalt/dist/gestalt.css';
```

That syntax is Webpack specific (and will work with Create React App), but you can use Gestalt anywhere that supports ES6 module bundling and global CSS.

## Development

Gestalt is a [multi-project monorepo](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/). The docs, components and integration tests are all organized as separate packages that share similar tooling.

Install project dependencies and run tests:

```bash
yarn
yarn test
```

Build and watch Gestalt:

```bash
cd packages/gestalt
yarn watch
```

Start the docs server:

```bash
cd docs
yarn start
open "http://localhost:8080"
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080) and click on a component to view the docs.

Using the Masonry playground:

```bash
cd test && yarn start
open "http://localhost:3000"
```

Running Masonry's integration tests. This will leave lots of Firefox processes hanging around, so please be warned.

```bash
./run_integration_tests
```

## Releasing

The following outlines our release process:

* Checkout a new branch.
* Bump package version in `packages/gestalt/package.json` & update `CHANGELOG.md`.
* Open a pull request with the new version and land that in master.
* Once the version is bumped in master, checkout that commit locally.
* Publish the tag, npm package, and docs with: `./scripts/publish.js`.
* Draft a release from the tag and update the release notes from the `CHANGELOG` at https://github.com/pinterest/gestalt/releases.
