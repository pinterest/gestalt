It will help you have a better experience when dealing with the assets panel and our Gestalt Figma libraries. \n\nDon't worry! The file you have linked to your designs <https://www.figma.com/file/50RRYnFcgPTQzy1AIjQoWB/[Library]-Gestalt-Handoff-Kit?node-id=1587:3092|(Gestalt handoff kit)> still provides you access to all assets and components to do design handoffs and annotations. And if you are looking for file setup and structure guidance, we invite you to check out our <https://www.figma.com/file/DJD8HWhXfnHF0TJxczx9kN/[Guidance]-File-setup-+-Design-handoff-guide|File setup + Handoff standards guide>. \n\nBonus: We added some file hygiene standards and naming conventions we are starting to adopt, and we believe it can help you as well optmize your design files and workflow. <https://www.figma.com/file/DJD8HWhXfnHF0TJxczx9kN/[Guidance]-File-setup-+-Design-handoff-guide?node-id=1:204|Check it out>!"
