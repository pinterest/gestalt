# git blame master ignore list.
#
# Since version 2.23 (released in August 2019), git-blame has a feature to
# ignore or bypass certain commits. This functionality was previously only
# available in the git-hyper-blame tool from Chrome's depot_tools.
#
# Instructions:
# - Only large (generally automated) reformatting or renaming commits should be
#   added to this list. Do not put things here just because you feel they are
#   trivial or unimportant. If in doubt, do not put it on this list.
# - Precede each revision with a comment containing the first line of its log.
# - Only put full 40-character hashes on this list (not short hashes or any
#   other revision reference).
# - Append to the bottom of the file (revisions should be in chronological order
#   from oldest to newest).
# - Because you must use a hash, you need to append to this list in a follow-up
#   commits to the actual reformatting commits that you are trying to ignore.
#
# This file contains a list of commits that are not likely what you are
# looking for in a blame, such as mass reformatting or renaming. You can set
# this file as a default ignore file for blame by running the following
# command.
#
# $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# Enable react/jsx-sort-props
