    In some cases, you may want to scale an image to fit into its container.
    To achieve that, you can set \`fit\` to either \`cover\` or \`contain\`, depending on the effect you wish to achieve.

    Contain: This makes it so that the image is "contained" within its container. This means that the image is resized appropriately
    such that the entire image can fit in the container, while maintaining its aspect ratio (think letterbox);

    ~~~jsx
    <Image alt="..." color="#000" fit="contain" src="..." />
    ~~~

    Cover: This does the opposite of contain and tries to scale the image as large as possible so that the entire container is occupied,
    while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.

    ~~~jsx
    <Image alt="..." color="#000" fit="cover" src="..." />
    ~~~

    Notes:

    * When using cover/contain, \`naturalHeight\` and \`naturalWidth\` are ignored since the aspect ratio is handled by the browser.
    * In order for cover/contain to work properly, the container must have some sort of implicit height.
