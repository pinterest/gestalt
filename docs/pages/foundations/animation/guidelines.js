        Animations should help a user complete a task. Ask yourself, what purpose does this animation serve? Does it help a new user understand a flow in the product? Does it help showcase something is processing or loading?


        Product animations typically fall into one of four categories:

        - feedback
        - transitions
        - education
        - celebration

        While celebratory animations typically occur on illustrative elements, like icons or illustrations, the other types of animations often apply to UI elements, like buttons or modals.

Similarly, a loading spinner may appear after a user submits a form to help indicate to the user that the form was submitted successfully and a process is beginning. Another example could be a card that grows slightly when hovered/focused to help indicate which card a user is interacting with."

              Another common use case for animations is to show a transition between two states in the UI. For example, a search icon button may expand into an input field when interacted with, or an overlay panel may slide in from the side of the screen to draw attention to it. Transitional animations help draw the user's attention to particular pieces of the UI, ideally helping them complete a task.

              Transitional animations should also follow an intuitive flow. For example, a drawer that appears from the bottom on mobile should slide up from the bottom of the screen and slide back down upon dismissal.

          Celebratory animations can be used to help a user feel accomplished after a certain event has occurred or add interest to an otherwise stagnant process. For example, confetti can be used to indicate a process has been completed successfully, like creating a first board while onboarding onto the app. Alternatively, graphics in an onboarding flow can be animated to draw attention and add interest to a multi-step modal.

          In general, illustrative animations add delight but are not critical for a user’s understanding of a task or feature. Because they are additive and not required, they should be used sparingly during high-value moments where an animation would be delightful and not distracting.

        The type of product should help inform what type of animations to use.  While feedback-based animations may be helpful in a business product, celebratory animations may not be. Again, consider if the animation is helping a user finish a task, or distracting them from getting things done efficiently. In a business product where users are intimately familiar with a task they perform multiple times a day, animation may negatively add to the time they spend on a process. Use a celebratory animation for rare moments, like the first time a user successfully creates a campaign, and not for completed tasks that happen frequently.

          Keep transitions direct, meaning the animation starts from a logical location that gives the moving object the shortest distance to travel to its final destination. In other words, do not animate a toast from the top of the screen down to the bottom of the screen if the final resting point is the bottom of the screen. Instead, begin the animation from the bottom of the screen.

          Also consider collisions when choosing animation origins. If notification cards can stack, they may animate in from the top right of a screen, but fade out to avoid colliding with incoming notifications.

          title="Easing and velocity"
          description={`
          The timing function of an animation should be determined by the property and object being animated.

          Properties unrelated to motion (like color and opacity) will not likely benefit from easing and can be done linearly. For example, a background color of a button that expands or changes upon hover can happen linearly as it provides feedback to the user about their cursor position.

          However, people experience motion non-linearly, so objects being moved can benefit from an easing timing function. For example, an object transitioning onto the screen from the right side may use ease-out as it slides into view to create visibility as fast as possible, and then ease-in upon its departure to create a smooth transition back to the main screen.

Note: these do not apply for “essential” animations, where [essential is defined](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html#essentialdef) as any animation where “if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, _and_ information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform.”
