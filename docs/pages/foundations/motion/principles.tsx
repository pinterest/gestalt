                      Animations are used sparingly, and only when there is a clear, intentional
                      reason for them.

                      They help a user complete a task or learn new information, and should not
                      distract the user for accomplishing a goal.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Every animation should serve a purpose and not be added simply for the sake of
                      having animation.

                      Animations must be designed and implemented to consider people with
                      disabilities, ensuring they do not cause the user any harm.

                      Most of the time this means respecting a user’s device motion settings and
                      disabling any animations when “use reduced motion” is turned on.

                        brings attention to the element but also can serve an educational purpose
