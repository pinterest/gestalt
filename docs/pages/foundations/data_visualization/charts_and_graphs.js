        - Bar charts

        The type of chart you use depends on how you are analyzing and monitoring data. Below are our most common use cases:
        - **Trends:** to see how data changes over time
        - **Parts-to-whole:** to see how a breakdown adds up to a total
        - **Comparison:** to see how multiple data sets compare to each other

Motor impairments may also make it difficult to navigate a chart, and some charting libraries may not have robust keyboard controls. Therefore, it’s good to allow people to also view chart data as a text-only table. Open the table in a modal or another page if the data can’t fit in the space that the chart is currently in."
