        Sparklines are small and simplified line or area charts that show the general trend over time. They can be included in display metrics, tables, spreadsheets and graphics. By placing sparklines in a relevant context, they give single numbers meaning.

        Regarding scale, there isn’t an aspect ratio where “one size fits all”. Sparklines should be moderately greater in width than in height, to avoid a spiky or flat profile, which can lead to incorrect data interpretation. When shown together, they should adopt the same range if they’re being used for trend comparison purposes.
