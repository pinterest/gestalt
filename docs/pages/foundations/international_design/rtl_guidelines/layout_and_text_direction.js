        The layout of the content must be adapted for RTL languages.
        - In Western languages, the layout is typically left-aligned, with text and images arranged from left to right.
        - In RTL languages, the layout is right-aligned, with text and images arranged from right to left. This can impact the positioning of elements such as icons, logos and navigation bars. It's also important to consider the impact on the overall design and visual hierarchy of the content. For example, graphics may need to be flipped, and menus and navigation bars may need to be moved to the right side of the screen.

One of the most important considerations when localizing content for RTL languages is the content alignment and direction of the text. All text, including headings, body copy‌ and buttons, must be aligned to the right. This may seem simple, but it can have a significant impact on the design of the content.

Full paragraphs of text in an untranslated LTR language, however, remain left-aligned.
