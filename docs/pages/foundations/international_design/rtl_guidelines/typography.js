Another important consideration is typography. RTL scripts require a different typography. The choice of font can also have a significant impact on the readability of RTL content. For example, letters can connect to each other, rather than standing alone as they do in LTR languages. This means that fonts need to be chosen carefully, to make sure that they are appropriate for the language being used.

Many **scripts**, such as **Arabic**, have special [orthographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_rules) rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special  [ligature forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(typography).  The rules governing ligature formation in Arabic can be quite complex, requiring special script-shaping technologies.

In Pinterest products, we default to device fonts so that fallbacks for RTL are handled automatically. Also, if you use our existing components for text, alignment and spacing are also handled out-of-the box.

Fonts are an essential element of web development, as they can influence the readability, accessibility‌ and the aesthetics of your app or site. When selecting fonts for RTL and LTR web development, you need to consider language support, font style, font size and spacing.

Language support is vital; you should use tools such as Google Fonts or Font Squirrel to find fonts that accommodate multiple languages and scripts. Additionally, the font style should be appropriate for the context of your content and consistent across different languages. Serif, sans-serif‌ or monospace fonts are all acceptable options; however, avoid using overly decorative fonts as they can reduce readability or cause visual clutter.

Finally, adjust the font size and spacing according to the text direction and the characteristics of the script. For example, RTL scripts tend to have more vertical strokes than LTR scripts, so you may need to increase the font size and line height for RTL text. CSS logical properties or SASS mixins can be used to apply different font styles based on the text direction.
