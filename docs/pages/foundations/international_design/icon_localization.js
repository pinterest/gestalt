        description={`
In general, we avoid using text in icons so that we don’t have to adapt icons to every language. However, there are times when using a particular script is necessary in an icon. Examples are text-editing UIs that communicate a script-related concept, like font-size choice. Consider creating an adapted version of those icons that'd include an RTL script.

Some icons might need to be removed because they don’t apply to an RTL language—for example, icons representing capitalization don't apply to Arabic.
