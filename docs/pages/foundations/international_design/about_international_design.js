Is the process by which businesses or other organizations develop international influence or start operating on an international scale.

A common misconception about creating global products is that we only need translation to get ready for international clients. However, we need to do more because the translation process only changes words from the source to the target language. Global products (including websites, apps and online services) need to be made usable and acceptable for people in their markets.

 The consensus for this term is: "Globalization is the integration of translation, internationalization and localization." The previous steps are all important in the quest to develop usable and acceptable global products. Issues will arise if any of these three aren&apos;t implemented, particularly if global products are marketed for more than one locale.'

        description={`
It's never too early to start talking about what we need to do to globalize a product; the sooner we include localization and internationalization in a product/feature conception, the more successful we'll be at overcoming language barriers and reaching people.

Identifying what's needed regarding design and code adaptation will allow a smooth localization and a successful product release. When designers are doing their mock-ups and wireframes, it is the perfect time to explore with the Localization Team how those prototypes look in languages and markets with different needs. These differences include:
- Language (script, expansion, orientation)
- Culture (appropriate and representative images and media)
- Currency
- Metric systems
- Date and time formats
- Laws and regulations
- Human behavior
