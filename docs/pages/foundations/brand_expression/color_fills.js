        description={`Pinterest product UI should be comprised of our hero and neutrals colors. We should continue to use our baseline color palette to allow photography, actions, and content to stand out. However, there are situations where color fills can help to express brand moments on product surfaces.

We recommend using the [extended color palette](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/foundations/color/palette#Colors) to bring attention to a specific brand or marketing moment, such as celebratory news, a new feature announcement, or educational flows. However, be mindful of color choices when applying color fills to UI elements next to status messages, as they use semantic colors to convey a specific meaning. See [background color usage](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/foundations/color/usage#Base-background-colors) for reference.

The Core brand team created a [baseline brand palette](https://www.figma.com/file/xjnifcms6gq4TVuHpbUSju/?node-id=2%3A13134) with some of our extended colors; you can enable it as a library in your Figma file.`}

          description={`Aim for sufficient color contrast in all appearances, no matter the color theme (light or dark mode). Our colors were defined to support you in achieving a reasonable contrast ratio between your foreground and background content in both appearances. At a minimum, ensure the contrast ratio between colors is no lower than 4.5:1, as this ratio ensures that your foreground content stands out from the background and helps your content meet recommended [WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

We suggest checking [Brand color expression + accessibility](https://brand.pinterest.com/color/) for references on color combination considering both themes. You can also use [color pairing Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/proto/WojVVmZpVP1aJcWPekckkP/Pinterest-Brand-Figma-Plugins?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=3%3A454&viewport=311%2C48%2C0.65&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=10%3A179) to test your color contrast level.
When using images or icons over color fills, ensure they look good in both themes. For icons, use the appropriate color tokens for each theme to provide readability and a great usability experience. For images, we suggest using the same asset if it looks good in both light and dark appearances. Consider softening the image treatment to avoid eye strain or to improve visibility; use your best judgment.

For more information about colors, check out our [color documentation](/foundations/color/palette).

#### Headings
Avoid using extended colors to text elements, as changing colors could lead to usability and cognitive issues due to their semantic meaning and required contrast level. Refer to our [text color tokens](/foundations/design_tokens/overview#Text-color) for guidance.

#### Body
Body should always be $color-text-default (default color), $color-text-inverse (text over a dark-colored background), or $color-text-subtle (secondary color), with the exception of [status text colors](/foundations/color/usage#Background-color), as they are needed to convey a certain meaning for specific cases. Avoid using alternative colors on body content, which could lead to [accessibility](/foundations/accessibility#Visuals) issues.

**Please note:** It only applies to product UI elements. For marketing websites, materials or promotional landing pages [reach out to Core Brand](https://brand.pinterest.com/) for text color guidance.

See below examples of UI elements using the appropriate text colors over color fills.

In Figma, you can use the [Able](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/734693888346260052/Able-%E2%80%93-Friction-free-accessibility) or [Pinterest brand color palettes](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1019681360638128106/Pinterest-Brand-color-palettes) plugins to check color contrast in your designs.

[Section 508](https://webaim.org/standards/508/checklist), which aligns with [WCAG 2.0 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), establishes a legal standard for the contrast level essential between text and its background. The baseline AA contrast standard is 4.5:1 for most text and 3:1 for large text.

Make sure your color fills have great contrast in our light and dark mode color themes.

Don’t use color exclusively to convey meaning. Color should only be used as an enhancement — if color is the only cue, that cue won’t get through as intended to everyone.`}
