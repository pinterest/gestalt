This is due to the incredible work of @mengqiuhu and @tsimpson with their proposed color palette. We’re hoping to build upon this work to develop dataviz components and guidelines in future sprints, so stay tuned!"

          "content": "We recently shipped a new [RadioGroup component](/radiogroup) which will make building forms easier and faster. The big change is that this component allows you to create a group of radio buttons as opposed to having to create each one independently. This may not have a ton of impact on your day-to-day, but we’re sharing it with you so that you remind your XFN buddies in case they aren’t aware. On that note, we’ve also deprecated our [RadioButton component](/radiobutton) in favor of RadioGroup."
