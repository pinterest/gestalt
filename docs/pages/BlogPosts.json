Our focus for this iteration was to drastically simplify the experience of using it in designs. This new component leverages all the new fancy bells and whistles Figma recently released, which _drastically_ reduced the number of variants for this component. We also added a [built-in introduction to the component](https://www.figma.com/file/AHcKJDgb7E7YswlgW1wY8E/Gestalt-for-iOS?node-id=13366%3A51700) and guides on common use-cases. We think it's going to be _big_ improvement.\n\nHowever, big improvements sometimes lead to (dun dun dunnn) breaking changes. This Pin is so different that we needed to essentially build it from scratch as a new component. Don't fret though, we've kept our previous version of the Pin component in our library for backward compatibility. That component will be sunset on September 30, 2022."
