It's an root-level Provider that supplies default values for common labels, like ModalAlert's `accessibilityDismissButtonLabel`. This means fewer props are required at the component callsite, making implementation faster and easier. Apps that require translations, like Pinboard, can pass those in [where DefaultLabelProvider is implemented](https://phabricator.pinadmin.com/diffusion/P/browse/master/webapp/app/packages/gestaltExtensions/GestaltDefaultLabelProvider.js).

We've also excited to hear that designers' prefer to learn about how to use our components from our [documentation site](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home). We're going all-in with this feedback to focus our libraries on a search-first experience while also removing the confusion regarding where to go to learn how to design with Gestalt. To do so, we're paring back our libraries to focus only on components/styles and removing non-essential pages/resources. This should make our libraries clearer and more focused on your desired workflow. It also has the added benefit of reducing the overall maintenance of these libraries, meaning we can focus our efforts on new/improve components, better documentation, etc.\n\nWe couldn't be more excited about this change. We _just_ rolled out this update for the iOS library and plan to apply the same changes to our Android and Web libraries in the weeks to come."

Our focus for this iteration was to drastically simplify the experience of using it in designs. This new component leverages all the new fancy bells and whistles Figma recently released, which _drastically_ reduced the number of variants for this component. We also added a [built-in introduction to the component](https://www.figma.com/file/AHcKJDgb7E7YswlgW1wY8E/Gestalt-for-iOS?node-id=13366%3A51700) and guides on common use-cases. We think it's going to be _big_ improvement.\n\nHowever, big improvements sometimes lead to (dun dun dunnn) breaking changes. This Pin is so different that we needed to essentially build it from scratch as a new component. Don't fret though, we've kept our previous version of the Pin component in our library for backward compatibility. That component will be sunset on September 30, 2022."
