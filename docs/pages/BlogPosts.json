[TextArea](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/web/textarea) now uses its existing `rows` prop to indicate both the minimum and the maximum number of rows shown, with scrollable overflow. [Table](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/web/table) saw a couple of changes: headers and footers now have a border, and Table.RowExpanded can be used in a controlled manner using the `expanded` prop. We also added a number of icons: `briefcase`, `sun`, and `moon` on web; and `arrow-circle-back`, `add-section`, `briefcase`, `move-pin`, and `workflow-queued` on Android. Finally, we've been upgrading Flow versions and are nearly at the most current version. This will greatly increase type safety for all our components!"

It's an root-level Provider that supplies default values for common labels, like ModalAlert's `accessibilityDismissButtonLabel`. This means fewer props are required at the component callsite, making implementation faster and easier. Apps that require translations, like Pinboard, can pass those in [where DefaultLabelProvider is implemented](https://phabricator.pinadmin.com/diffusion/P/browse/master/webapp/app/packages/gestaltExtensions/GestaltDefaultLabelProvider.js).

We're going all-in with this feedback to focus our libraries on a search-first experience while also removing the confusion regarding where to go to learn how to design with Gestalt. To do so, we're paring back our libraries to focus only on components/styles and removing non-essential pages/resources. This should make our libraries clearer and more focused on your desired workflow. It also has the added benefit of reducing the overall maintenance of these libraries, meaning we can focus our efforts on new/improve components, better documentation, etc.\n\nWe couldn't be more excited about this change.

Our focus for this iteration was to drastically simplify the experience of using it in designs. This new component leverages all the new fancy bells and whistles Figma recently released, which _drastically_ reduced the number of variants for this component. We also added a [built-in introduction to the component](https://www.figma.com/file/AHcKJDgb7E7YswlgW1wY8E/Gestalt-for-iOS?node-id=13366%3A51700) and guides on common use-cases. We think it's going to be _big_ improvement.\n\nHowever, big improvements sometimes lead to (dun dun dunnn) breaking changes. This Pin is so different that we needed to essentially build it from scratch as a new component. Don't fret though, we've kept our previous version of the Pin component in our library for backward compatibility. That component will be sunset on September 30, 2022."
