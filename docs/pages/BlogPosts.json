[Image](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/web/image) now passes through the `event` object in `onLoad` and `onError` to allow for more precise responses to these events. We replaced Image's `importance` prop with `fetchPriority` for use in performance tweaks in Chromium-based browsers. Image also now always outputs `<img>` — previously it would output a `<div>` when the image was scaled, as a hack to support IE11. [Popover](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/web/popover#Dismiss-button) has a new prop, `showDismissButton`, to give users an obvious affordance to close the element.

It's an root-level Provider that supplies default values for common labels, like ModalAlert's `accessibilityDismissButtonLabel`. This means fewer props are required at the component callsite, making implementation faster and easier. Apps that require translations, like Pinboard, can pass those in [where DefaultLabelProvider is implemented](https://phabricator.pinadmin.com/diffusion/P/browse/master/webapp/app/packages/gestaltExtensions/GestaltDefaultLabelProvider.js).

Thankfully Flow provides utility types for this situation: `$ElementType<React$ElementConfig<typeof ComponentName>, 'propName'>`. Since this syntax isn't easy to remember, we added [a note in our FAQ](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/get_started/faq#Component-usage) as well as a button that appears next to every prop in the Props tables that will copy the correct syntax to your clipboard.\n\nWe also updated the code examples for Avatar, AvatarGroup, Box, Button, ComboBox, Flex, and IconButton to use the new Sandpack editor."

So far, we've shipped hot-off-the-press docs for [Avatar](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/android/avatar) and [IconButton](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/android/iconbutton). Expect _many more_ dropping in the weeks to come. And yeah, before you ask, these docs are available for both Android and iOS. Our goal is to prioritize the most high-frequency components to cover components that constitute the top 80% most frequently used. \n\nKeep in mind, these docs are still a little light, but we wanted to get them out the door in order to get your feedback. So please let us know how we can improve these and we'll get on it!"

This should make these components easier for you all to use and easier for us to maintain.\n\nLastly, for our Foundations library, we added some missing icons to our library.

We also have a handy footer nav on the home page with quick links to important things like our Figma libraries, plugins, Slack channels and engineering resources.\n\n Things are still a bit empty at the moment, but expect that to change _soon_."

This new component leverages all the new fancy bells and whistles Figma recently released, which _drastically_ reduced the number of variants for this component.

This Pin is so different that we needed to essentially build it from scratch as a new component. Don't fret though, we've kept our previous version of the Pin component in our library for backward compatibility. That component will be sunset on September 30, 2022."

So if you're feeling inspired to be inspired, check out our [Gestalt Pinterest account](https://www.pinterest.com/pinterestgestalt/). We pin all sorts of cool things (mostly about design systems, because well, duh). We have some cool stuff up our sleeve for this account, so stay tuned."

The big change is that this component allows you to create a group of radio buttons as opposed to having to create each one independently. This may not have a ton of impact on your day-to-day, but we’re sharing it with you so that you remind your XFN buddies in case they aren’t aware. On that note, we’ve also deprecated our [RadioButton component](/web/radiobutton) in favor of RadioGroup."
