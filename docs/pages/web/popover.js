We recommend passing the following ARIA attribute to Popover for a better screen reader experience:

- \`accessibilityLabel\`: describes the main purpose of a Popover for the screen reader. Should be unique and concise. For example, "Save to board" instead of "Popover".  It populates [aria-label](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#dialog_roles_states_props).
- \`accessibilityDismissButtonLabel\`: describes the purpose of the dismiss button on Popover for the screen reader. Should be clear and concise. For example, "Close board selection popover" instead of "Close".

To further assist screen readers, we recommend passing the following ARIA attributes to the _anchor element_:

- \`accessibilityHaspopup\`: informs the screen reader that there’s a Popover attached to the anchor element. It populates [aria-haspopup](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menu-button/menu-button-links.html).
- \`accessibilityExpanded\`: informs the screen reader whether Popover is currently open or closed. It populates [aria-expanded](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menu-button/menu-button-links.html).
- \`accessibilityControls\`: match with the \`id\` of the associated Popover whose contents or visibility are controlled by the interactive component so that screen reader users can identify the relationship between elements. It populates [aria-controls](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menu-button/menu-button-links.html).

For the \`role\` prop, use:
- 'dialog' if the Popover is a dialog that prompts the user to enter information or requires a response.
- 'menu' if the Popover presents a list of choices to the user.
- 'listbox' if the Popover is a widget that allows the user to select one or more items (whose role is option) from a list. May also include a search option.
- 'tooltip' if the Popover is a simple contextual text bubble that displays a description on a feature.

Popover requires a reference element, typically [Button](/web/button) or [IconButton](/web/iconbutton), to set its position. The \`anchor\` ref can be directly set on the reference component itself. If the components don’t support \`ref\`, the anchor ref can be set to a parent [Box](/web/box).

Popover calculates its position based on the bounding box of the \`anchor\`. Therefore, the \`anchor\` ref should only include the trigger element itself, usually [Button](/web/button) or [IconButton](/web/iconbutton), or the specific feature component that requires an educational Popover.

Popover is typically used within [Layer](/web/layer). Layer renders Popover outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent allowing it to overlay surrounding content. Popover calculates its position based on the bounding box of the \`anchor\`. Within Layer, Popover no longer shares a relative root with the \`anchor\` and requires \`positionRelativeToAnchor=false\` to properly calculate its position relative to the anchor element.

Using \`Layer\` with Popover eliminates the need to use \`z-index\` to solve stacking context conflicts. Popovers within Modals and OverlayPanels with z-indexes don't require \`zIndex\` in \`Layer\` thanks to the built-in ScrollBoundaryContainer.

**[PopoverEducational](/web/popovereducational)**
Popover used for education or onboarding experiences.

**[Dropdown](/web/dropdown)**
Dropdown is an element constructed using Popover as its container. Use Dropdown to display a list of actions or options in a Popover.

**[Toast](/web/toast)**
Toast provides feedback on an interaction. One example of Toast is the confirmation that appears when a Pin has been saved. Toasts appear at the bottom of a desktop screen or top of a mobile screen instead of being attached to any particular element on the interface.

**[Tooltip](/web/tooltip)**
Tooltip describes the function of an interactive element, typically [IconButton](/web/iconbutton), on hover. While Popovers offer broader content options, such as [Button](/web/button) and [Images](/web/image), Tooltips are purely text-based.

**[Layer](/web/layer)**
Layer renders Popover outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent and prevents surrounding components overlaying Popover. See the [with Layer](#With-layer) variant to learn more.

**[ScrollBoundaryContainer](/web/utilities/scrollboundarycontainer)**
ScrollBoundaryContainer is needed for proper positioning when Popover is anchored to an element that is located within a scrolling container. The use of ScrollBoundaryContainer ensures that Popover remains attached to its anchor when scrolling. See the [within scrolling containers](#Within-scrolling-containers) variant to learn more.
