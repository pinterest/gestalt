      - Showcase key features or services with icons and brief descriptions
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="When not to use" />
     - Not suitable for displaying complex content requiring extensive explanation
     - Avoid using ListAction for long lists of data. It's better for highlighting and navigating

    <Dont title="Don't" />
    Use more than three lines of subtext as it reduces scanability and can pose issues with internationalization, spacing, and comprehension.

## Accessibility

- Make sure the ListAction component includes appropriate list markup, with screen readers announcing the number of items, along with each item.
- Make sure that interactive elements in list items, such as checkboxes or buttons, are both focusable and usable.
- Include descriptive alt text for icons and labels that convey the purpose of each item.

People use Androidâ€™s accessibility features, such as TalkBack and dynamic text sizing to personalize how they interact with their device. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Material Design and development documentation about accessibility for Android:

## Variants

### Defualt

The default ListAction items don't include a start item and only display text, but they still allow for end items to be displayed.

### Start items

ListAction items can display three different start items.

1. **Avatar**
  Commonly used to represent users, profiles, comments or messages in a list.
2. **Icon**
  Using icons can effectively communicate meaning or context, thereby enhancing the visual information conveyed by list items.
3. **Image**
  This is usually used when a visual representation is necessary and can also be used to represent a Pin or board.

## Writing
- Use short, meaningful labels that succinctly describe the purpose of each item
- Avoid truncation. If your copy is longer than three lines, consider revising the text.
- For headings use nouns or short phrases with title-style capitalization, and don't use punctuation.

## Localization
Be sure to localize the ListAction text. Note that localization can lengthen text by 20 to 30%.
