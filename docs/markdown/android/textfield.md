<Group>
<Do title="When to use" />
- Any time succinct data needs to be entered by a user, like a date, email address, name, or Pin title.

</Group>
<Group>
<Dont title="When not to use" />
- Situations where long amounts of text need to be entered, since the full content of the TextField will be truncated. Use [TextArea](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/web/textarea) instead.

## Accessibility

People use Android's accessibility features, such as TalkBack and dynamic text sizing to personalize how they interact with their devices. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Material Design and development documentation about accessibility for Android:

[Accessible design on Android](https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html#understanding-accessibility/)
[Accessible development on Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility)


### Labels
Be sure to provide a unique for each TextField.


### Validation
When providing a validation message, make sure the instructions are clear and help users complete the field. For example, "Passwords must contain at least 20 characters". In addition, use the helper text to provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the text field or to indicate any needed input, allowed formats, timing limitations, or other pertinent information.
These practices give users of assistive technologies more information about the form, helping them to fill it out.


### Keyboards
Make sure your keyboards match the function of your form field. For example, asking for a phone number should pull up the phone pad keyboard.


## Variants

### With helper text
Whenever you want to provide more information about a form field, you should use helper text.
<ImgContainer src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/68/48/66/684866b8a4727cd935a5ffd6271929ac.jpg" alt="A form field with helper text under the form that reads, enter a valid web address."/>

### Disabled
Disabled Text Fields cannot be interacted with. They also do not need to meet contrast requirements, so do not use them to present info to the user.

### Error
Text Field can display an error message below the field. Always include an icon to illustrate the error by more than just color. 
<ImgContainer src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9d/02/d4/9d02d4d386da2010e4c50fa50d8c2cc8.jpg" alt="A form field with an error. The error text reads, that username is not available."/>

### Success
Text Field can display a success message below the field. Always include an icon to illustrate the success by more than just color. 
<ImgContainer src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/66/b5/4166b58231fa38697bd1d8a91e18255d.jpg" alt="A text field that was successfully submitted. The success text reads, that username is available."/>

## Animation
By default, the placeholder text will animate up into the label position when the user interacts with the field. Visit Apple’s HIG for more information on [Animation and Motion](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/animation/).
