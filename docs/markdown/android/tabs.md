## Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="When to use" />
      - To break up a large collection of content into logical, digestible views.
      - To switch between different, yet related views, such as Updates and Messages.
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="When not to use" />
    - When any UI or content above the Tabs is altered upon selection. Use Link instead. 
    - To break up content that is not related to each other or is not on the same hierarchical level. 
    - To filter content. Consider SegmentedControl instead.
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

## Best practices

- Place Tabs directly above the relevant content. 
- Avoid using more than 6 Tabs. Consider using a different component like Sheet.
- Order Tabs by relevance - the first tab should be the most logical starting view.

## Accessibility

People use Android’s accessibility features, such as TalkBack and dynamic text sizing to personalize how they interact with their device. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Material Design and development documentation about accessibility for Android:

## Variants

### Alignment

Tabs can be aligned to either the start or end point depending on language direction or centered.

1. **Start or end aligned (Default)**
Use if you have more than three tabs. Start or end aligned tabs will scroll horizontally if content is long enough to flow out of the frame. 
2. **Center aligned**
This variant may be used if you have two or three tabs. Center aligned Tabs should not be used if labels are long or if you have more than three Tabs. The center-aligned style of Tabs is used primarily for navigational Tabs and sits in the header of the screen.

### Style

This is the default tab style. Use the filled style for any Tabs that sit within a screen.

### Animation

By default, Sheet animates in from the bottom of the screen. It animates out when the header close button is pressed, the user swipes down or the user taps outside of the sheet.
