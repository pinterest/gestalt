## Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
<Group>
<Do title="When to use" />
- Use as symbolic communication for elements that do not have room for text. In this case, ensure the icon choice is easily recognizable and makes sense to international users.
- To help with quick scanning by adding rhythm and hierarchy to the design.

</Group>
<Group>
<Dont title="When not to use" />
- For decorative purposes or visual embellishment, like how you would use an illustration. Contact us if this is needed.
- As a visual reinforcement for associated text without adding new meaning.
- To communicate status or health. Use Status instead.
- As an interactive element (e.g., hover, focus, click/tap). Use [IconButton](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/web/iconbutton) instead.

## Best practices

- If your icons are interactive, use the IconButton component and ensure that they utilize at least 48 x 48dp touch targets.
- When designing in iOS and Android, use platform-specific icons as they are most recognizable to that platformâ€™s users.
- When possible, include a visible text label.
- Icons should always be a solid color and should inherit the color of the surrounding text if applicable.

For general Icon best practices, refer to the web [Icon documentation](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/web/icon).

## Accessibility

People use Android's accessibility features, such as TalkBack and dynamic text sizing to personalize how they interact with their devices. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Material Design and development documentation about accessibility for Android:

## Variants

### Styling
For information on colors and states, refer to the [web Icon guidelines](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/web/icon).

### Platform-specific icons

1. **Share**
On Android, use the android-share icon to indicate the ability to share an element. 
2. **Check**
On Android, use the standard radio button instead of an icon.
3. **Back**
On Android use the arrow icon titled directional-arrow-left to indicate backward movement.

### Size
Generally 16dp and 24dp icons should be used in mobile interfaces. When icons are interactive, they should use the IconButton component with its built in 48 x 48dp touch targets. 

1. **12dp**
Used only for Pins and Boards. 
2. **16dp**
Default icon size. Used often, any time an icon is needed, i.e. icons in headers, close icons, etc.
3. **20dp**
Used only when pairing with 16dp (Size200) text.
4. **24dp**
Used for action bar navigation elements or when a larger icon is needed. 
5. **32dp**
Used sparingly to draw attention to an icon that might otherwise be missed.
