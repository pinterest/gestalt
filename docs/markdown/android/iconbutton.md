title: IconButton
description: IconButton allows users to take actions and make choices with a single click or tap. IconButtons use icons instead of text to convey available actions on a screen. IconButton is typically found in forms, dialogs and toolbars. Some buttons are specialized for particular tasks, such as navigation or presenting menus.

## Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="When to use" />
    - Interface space is limited. Prioritize using a Button if space is available.
    - Triggering a Modal to complete a related task.
    - Creating visual separation of actions in text-heavy content.
    - Lower-emphasis actions that don't impede users from completing a task.
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="When not to use" />
    - Displaying icons that don't have actions associated with them. Use an Icon instead.
    - Displaying multiple IconButtons on a surface that uses the same icon for different actions.
    - Text is better suited to convey the action and/or the icon isn't quickly recognizable by users.
    - Destructive, high-emphasis actions, e.g "delete", "remove".

## Mobile best practices

- Avoid using a floating icon button if it obscures important information on the screen. 
- IconButton on mobile should primarily utilize the lg (48dp) size as the increased size will better accommodate tapping with a finger.   

For general IconButton best practices, refer to the [IconButton web documentation](/web/iconbutton).

## Accessibility

People use Androidâ€™s accessibility features, such as TalkBack and dynamic text sizing to personalize how they interact with their device. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Material Design and development documentation about accessibility for Android:

[Accessible development on Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility)

## Variants

### Size

1. **lg** **(48pt)**
Large is the only size that should be used on Pinner surfaces.
2. **md** **(32pt)**
Medium is the size used on more dense UI such as business surfaces or internal tools.
3. **sm** **(24pt)**
Small IconButton should be used sparingly and only in places where the UI is very dense.

### Elevation

1. **Flat**
Flat components sit right on top of the background, with no elevation. Therefore they do not have a drop shadow. 
2. **Floating**
Floating components are lifted off of the background, with high-emphasis elevation. They present with a drop shadow which can serve as an affordance for scrolling behavior.
