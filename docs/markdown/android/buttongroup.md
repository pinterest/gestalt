## Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="When to use" />
    - Showing all the available options at one glance
    - Arranging a group of buttons in a horizontal or vertical stack due to limited space
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="When not to use" />
     - Switching between different views. Use [Tabs](/android/tabs) instead
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

## Best practices

Keep primary actions (ex: submitting a form) on the right and secondary actions (ex: cancel) on the left. When used vertically, keep the primary action at the top. 

For general Button best practices, refer to the [Button documentation](/android/button).

## Accessibility

Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Material Design and development documentation about accessibility for Android:
