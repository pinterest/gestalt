### Parallel structure

When you’re presenting multiple options (ex: bulleted lists, menus), use a similar structure for each item so everything’s easy to scan and understand.  

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Start all items the same way (ex: all verbs, all nouns)
     - Use the same structure (ex: if one option ends in “-ing” then all options should end that way)
     - Examples: 
        - Log out
        - Get help
        - Report a bug
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t use a variety of different structures in the same series
     - Examples: 
        - Log out
        - Help center
        - Report a bug
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

You should also use a parallel structure for multi-screen education punctuation, too. By which we mean: If your education is sentences across three screens, if one of them ends with a period, they all should.

- Sign up for one today.

Not this...
- Find new ideas to try
- Pinterest is the home of the world’s best ideas. Do you have a free account?
- Sign up for one today

See? Just one two-sentence screen turns them all into punctuated screens. However, if all of these were one-phrase screens (Find new ideas to try / Pinterest is the home of the world’s best ideas / Sign up for an account today), no punctuation would be needed. So it goes!

### Addressing people by name

Calling out someone by name can be a very effective way to grab their attention, but it can get old quick. That’s why we do it only sparingly. 

When using the Pinner’s name (or, for that matter, their board’s name) in UI, we recommend you don’t use apostrophes (ex: “Pins from Evany,” not “Evany’s Pins”). There’s too much that can go wrong.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do examples"/>
     - Got it! You won't see Pins from Matt in the future.
     - Want to see a new board from Davy Jones?
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't examples"/>
     - Got it! You won't see Matt's Pins in the future. 
     - See Davy Jones's new board
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

### Placeholder text

Also called “ghost text” (whOooOooo), this should be either exemplary (filling in an exact example of what someone would write in the text field) or descriptive (displaying how the function should work or what purpose it serves, if an example would be confusing to the user).

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Use general and realistic (rather than “funny”) example text
     - Open descriptive placeholder text with a verb to immerse people in the action
     - Examples: 
        - www.yoursite.com
        - Add what your board’s about
        - Pick an end date or range of dates 
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Use questions
     - Use the first person
     - Use a one-word placeholder like "Add" that doesn't illustrate the feature's function or value
     - Examples: 
        - www.mysite.com
        - What’s this board about?
        - My board is about bull terriers 
        - June 19, 2002
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

### Progressive disclosures

Give people the minimum amount of info they need to complete the task at hand.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Break info into small bites
     - Show info when it’s most helpful
     - Make added details optional, so people who want more info can easily get it, but the experience isn’t cluttered with “in the weeds” details
     - Examples: 
        - Step one (Pin view): See something you want to save for later? Just tap Save.
        - Step two (create board view): You collect your Pins on boards. Make as many as you need!
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t overwhelm people by listing all the possible information they might need up front
     - Examples: 
        - Solo info dialog (Pin view):See something you want to save for yourself? Go ahead and tap Save. Then you’ll need to create a board for your Pin to live on.
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

### Referencing the interface

When you’re describing something the Pinner has to do on Pinterest, sometimes it’s helpful to reference the thing they need to click or select.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Refer to the elements of the interface only if it isn’t otherwise clear what you’re talking about
     - Use menu and button (and occasionally icon)
     - Examples: 
        - Use + to add a Pin
        - Select Log out from the menu
        - Type in your search
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t describe the interface element unless it’s absolutely necessary for clarity—for more details, see our full list of terms
     - Don’t use words like “click” or “tap” if possible, or assume universal accessibility
     - Examples: 
        - Select the “+” button to add a Pin
        - Select Log out from the dropdown menu
        - Click here to begin your search
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

### Rhetorical questions

Avoid them, unless it’s the shortest and most direct way to get the message across (ex: in a confirmation toast). For a gut-check, ask yourself: “Would I actually say this out loud?” The answer’s probably “nah.”

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do examples"/>
     - Delete group board
     - Enjoy!
     - Keep scrolling to see more
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't examples"/>
     - How about deleting this group board?
     - Are we having fun yet?
     - Want more Pinterest?
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

### Settings

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Use Yes | No for toggles
     - Use sentence case for settings fields
     - Use “you/your”
     - Examples: 
       - Also get an email when someone: Comments on your Pin
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t use On | Off for toggles
     - Don’t use “me/mine”
     - Examples:
        - Also get an email when someone: Comments on my Pin
  </Group>
</TwoCol>


### Specific verbs

In UI writing, sometimes it’s hard to choose between two seemingly similar verbs. Here are some tips:

**Pick vs. choose vs. select:**
Pick and choose sound more conversational in en_US/UK, and should always be used when discussing taste (“Pick your favorite topics!”) or other more human concepts. If you’re thinking about saying “choose,” try “pick” instead (unless you’re trying to avoid monotony). 

*Pick:*
- Pick 5 topics you love

<br/>

**See vs. view:**
View derives from some action on the user's part (choosing filters, say) and See comes from work Pinterest’s already done for the user (like providing additional search results/related Pins).

*See:*
- Come see! (tooltip on more ideas tabs)
- See ideas trending in Hounds (email notif)

*View:*
- View your map (map button CTA)
- View in chronological order (made up filter sort)

### Tenses

Use the [present perfect](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/present-perfect-continuous-tense/) tense in UI writing, even when using a contraction seems more conversational. 

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - You have a new follower
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - You've got a new follower
  </Group>
</TwoCol>


### Pin puns

We all love a good Pin pun, but unfortunately, they don’t translate very well. We save Pin puns for internal comms, but don’t use them in external language or content.
