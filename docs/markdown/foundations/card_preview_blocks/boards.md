    <Do title="When to use" />
      - To suggest boards containing content that a Pinner might like based on their engagement, interests, boards, demographic information, or other signals
      - To suggest boards created by another user (ex: Pinner, company, brand)
      - To suggest boards featuring a Pin(s) the user has saved/looked at

## Best practices
- Always show two boards or sections per card. More or less than two will display inconsistently within the card. 
- Use any variations of the Board & Section component besides CTAs. Board CTAs can interfere with the selection of the card itself. 
For general [Component] best practices, refer to the [Board & Section documentation]().
