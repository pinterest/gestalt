## The Pinterest Voice

The Pinterest voice is our brand personality—it’s a part of everything we do. When writing at Pinterest, keep these guiding words in mind:

**Simplify ideas to make the complex clear**
Do the hard work to make ideas crisp and concise. Don’t make them think. Avoid fluff. Inform people, but keep your sentences short so they are easy to read. Long, complicated sentences often obscure their main ideas. Opt for short sentences and short words. 

**Keep it conversational so you don’t lose your reader**
We’re all just humans talking to humans, so read your work out loud. If it’s hard for you to read aloud, it’ll be hard for people to read. The moment when you stumble over the words is the moment your audience will stop reading them. Edit it again. Start over. Keeping things conversational helps you stay accessible, warm and friendly while also being direct.  

**Add a dash of cleverness to grab their attention**
Put your best stuff up top. Ask yourself: Would people stop what they’re doing to read this? Tell their friends “you gotta see this”? Every big initiative at Pinterest should have a short, clear description—it should be the first line we see or hear. When appropriate (and avoiding hyperbole) add a bit of wordplay, even a pun, alliteration, anaphora or another rhetorical device to help your writing stand out.

## Formatting
### Dates and abbreviations

| Format             | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Links

**When adding links on Pinterest**
Links should be a part of a sentence, and it should be clear where you go or what happens once you click. 

In UI writing, if you have a one-sentence string with a link to follow, put it on a separate line:
We all love Story Pins
[See why](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home)

If this isn't possible, punctuate the one-sentence string to visually separate it from the link:
We all love Story Pins. [See why](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home)

In longform writing, make sure to punctuate when the link falls at the end of a sentence. Make sure the punctuation is not part of the hyperlinked phrase:
We all love Story Pins. If you still have questions, head over to our [Help Center](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home).

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
      - Keep links at the end of sentences, where possible
      - When linking a phrase, link the verb and the subject or else it looks complete (“[Call our help line](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home),” not “Call our [help line](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home)”)
      - Limit number of calls to action 
      - Make link text as self-evident as possible, so people know where the link will take them
      - If you’re spelling the URL out, shorten it as much as humanly possible, without sacrificing functionality
      - Links should be in bold with no period after, like this: Learn more
      - In blog posts where you’re shouting out a brand, don’t include the http://www—just start at the name of the site 
      - Examples:

**When creating URLs on Pinterest**
<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
      - Use common, short words that describe the page
      - Use one word (if you have to use multiple words, use a hyphen to separate them)
      - Start URLs with the website—skip the http://www.
      - Examples:
        - pinterest.com/gifts
        - pinterest.com/dolcegabbana
        - brand.pinterest.com
        - business.pinterest.com/en/how-pinterest-works
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't" />
     - Don’t use acronyms 
     - Don’t use numbers
     - Don’t make URLs case sensitive
     - Don’t include http:// or www. (like we said!)
     - Examples: 
        - pinterest.com/giftsanddelights
        - pinterest.com/dolceandgabbana

### Lists
Everyone loves a good list! Lists help break up text and make things scannable, so we’re totally into them. 

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
      - Use sentence case  
      - Use a parallel structure (start with all verbs or all nouns)
      - Use bullets whenever possible. Exception: If it’s a sequential list (like steps you have to take), use a numbered list
      - Capitalize the beginning of each bullet
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't" />
     - Don’t use punctuation. Exception: If at least one item in the list includes two sentences, use punctuation for all the items in the list
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

### Numbers
<br/>
**Numbers**
When you’re using numbers in tight spaces or places people are likely to scan, numerals can make your copy easier to read fast. Use numerals (1, 2, 15) unless it looks jarring written out (unless this looks jarring with the number “one”).
<br/>
- Abbreviate once you hit a thousand and round to the nearest hundred (except prices and percentages). Once you hit a million, round to the nearest hundred thousand. 
  - 1.5k Pins (1500-1549), 1.6k (1550-1599)
  - 2.8m (2,750,000-2,849,999)
<br/>
- Lowercase your increments, units and labels
  - 100x, not 100X (“Saves increased by 100x”)
  - 5m, not 5M (“5m recipes on Pinterest”) 
  - 5x increased engagement, not “5x Increased engagement”
<br/>
- Count a numeral in a UI heading as a capital letter when it kicks off a string, and treat the rest of the sentence’s title case thusly. For example:
  - 100 comments, not 100 Comments
  - 12 shoppable Pins, not 12 Shoppable Pins
<br/>
**Percentages**
  - Don’t use a comma until you hit 5 digits. (1230% vs. 12,300%)
  - (Nerd alert: [See how it plays out for each language](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VF6eScsgbC8RgvXZW3lwjKu3XEpGnqFaFR4FfCpUq_k/edit#gid=0).)
<br/>
**ZIP Code**
  - Always capitalize ZIP
  - Use 5-digit pattern (80538)
<br/>
**Decimals**
  - For values > 0, show one decimal place (5.2 is good)
  - For values < 0, show two decimal places so it looks precise, but not intimidating/overly long (5.25% is good)
  - For whole numbers, don't use a decimal (10 is good, 10.0 isn't necessary)
<br/>
**In longform writing**
- Limit how many numbers you include in a single paragraph or post so it’s easy for people to understand
- Always spell out numbers under 10 in longform writing (in UI writing, use the shortest possible writing—in this case, numerals—every time).
- When you’re sharing info about “steps” to do something, keep the steps between three and five. If there are fewer than three steps, think of another way to share that info—you don’t need steps to do it. If it’s more than five steps, try a format that’s more detailed, like a playbook.

### Timestamps
Timestamps should make sense when you scan them—no one should have to do lots of mental math to figure out when something happened. In small spaces (like messages) we can abbreviate. 

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
      - Just now! up to 59 seconds
      - 1 minute/X minutes up to an hour
      - 1 hour/X hours up to a day 
      - 1 day/X days up to a week
      - 1 week/X weeks up to a month 
      - After a month, switch to a MM/DD/YY date
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't" />
     - 3 seconds
     - 96 minutes ago
     - 30 min
     - 36 weeks ago
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

**Using timestamps in small spaces...**
- Xm
- Xh
- Xd
- Xw
- After a month, switch to a MM/YY date
<br/>
**Using timestamps in Ads Manager (including graphs)...**
- Use the 24-hour clock structure
- 00:00 is midnight
- 23:59 is the last minute of the day
- Use PST/PDT throughout, not UTC

## Grammar and punctuation

### Capitalization
Sentence case is easy to read, and feels way more conversational (vs. title case, which feels very Grand and Self Important). It’s our go-to approach, with only a few exceptions.

**Use sentence case**
- Board name and section name placeholder text
- Business site and blog post headlines
- Buttons
- Error message titles
- Titles of talks at events 
- Form field titles
- Links
- Memo titles
- Menu items
- Microcopy and helper text
- Navigation 
- Page titles
- Placeholder text (gray instructional text within form fields)
- Sub-headlines
- Tabs/sections of Pinterest (following feed, more ideas tab, etc.)
<br/>
**Use title case**
- Brands: If you must refer to a brand, make sure to capitalize it (“Crock-Pot” rather than “crockpot”) and in the third person use “they” not “it”
- Holidays (you can always Google to double check tricky ones like Father’s Day or Back to School)
- Job titles
- Pin: Always capitalize—it’s a legal thing (see How to use Pin for more!)
- Pinner (Note: Use this sparingly, and ideally not at all. Instead, say “people” or “people on Pinterest”) 
- Proper nouns (World War II, Scarlett Johansson), acronyms (NFL, DIY)
- Topics in product UI/New User Activation (ex: Weddings, DIY, Naruto and Anime)
- Generation names (ex: Baby Boomers, Gen X)

---

### Contractions

Use contractions whenever possible to make your work conversational, in UI and blog posts. (“Isn’t” is just warmer than “is not;” always opt for “it’s” rather than “it is.”) 
- Don’t use old-timey or made-up sounding contractions like “shant” or “t’wouldn’t,” please.
- Don’t use double negatives like “I won’t bake no cake.”

---

### Hyphenation
According to the AP Style Guide/Purdue Writing Lab (our when-in-doubt go-to), you should
- Hyphenate a phrase when it’s acting like an adjective, coming before a noun 
- Don’t hyphenate an entire descriptive phrases 
- For a phrase you’re not sure of the hyphenation of...just Google it! Check if its most common usage is hyphenated.
- Use hyphens to connect a prefix to a phrase, when applicable (“pro-Obama”).

### Punctuation

Pinterest’s UI is clean, light and modern, which means using as little punctuation as possible. For tips about punctuation for longform writing, refer to the [AP Style Guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/journalism_and_journalistic_writing/ap_style.html).

<br/>

| Punctuation              | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ampersand (&)        | Don’t use! Use a plus sign if you must.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Colon (:)            | Use to kick off a list, introduce an explanation or definition, or for editorial emphasis in longer form writing. <br/>Followed by a single space. Whether you capitalize the next letter depends on what your information is. DO capitalize if the next word is a proper noun, or you're writing an entire sentence after the colon. Do NOT capitalize if you're writing a fragment after the colon. <br/>Sometimes you’ll see a dot used in our UI like a colon in board headers—treat it the same way, and start with a capital letter! |
| Semi-colon (;)       | Don’t use—instead, rewrite the sentence or break it in two <br/>Use: Lili’s son couldn’t decide between a Superman and Spiderman party; Lili created a Pinterest board to consolidate ideas for the ultimate superhero birthday bash. <br/>Don’t use: When Lili’s son couldn’t decide between a Superman and Spiderman party, Lili created a Pinterest board to consolidate ideas for the ultimate superhero birthday bash.                                                                                                                |
| Comma (,)            | Don’t use the serial comma (boards, sections and Pins vs. boards, sections, and Pins)—see “Oxford comma” below<br/>Don’t use in stats, numbers under 100,000 or percentages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Em Dash (—)          | Use sparingly to denote a significant break in the sentence or parenthetical aside—don’t over do it, though<br/>No spaces!<br/>Use this to sign a name in an email. (—The Pinterest team)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| En Dash (–)          | Don’t use—use an em dash (—) instead!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Exclamation mark (!) | Use as you would in a real conversation: In sentences that sound like they have an exclamation when you say them out loud, or to introduce ideas that people will be genuinely excited about. <br/>Use sparingly! <br/>Use: Introducing secret boards! <br/>Use: We’re so glad to have you on Pinterest!<br/>Don’t use to add pep to inherently unexciting concept or when the tone is out of step with people’s emotions: <br/>Don’t use: Here’s how to change your password! <br/>Don’t use: You’ve been locked out of your account!         |
| Hyphen/dash (-)      | Hyphen/dash (-) - Use to show a range of numbers when space is tight (“10-20”) or spell it out in long form (“10 to 20”)<br/>To add a significant break in a sentence, use and em-dash instead<br/>See Hyphenation section                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Language and terminology

### Inclusive language

Using correct terminology to describe different groups is extremely important (and it comes up a lot in areas like marketing materials and internal communications). When in doubt or when looking for something more specific, email the D+I team; you can also refer to [A Progressive’s Style Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.sumofus.org/images/SUMOFUS_PROGRESSIVE-STYLEGUIDE.pdf) as a fantastic free resource.

**Specific terms for group identification...**
- Refer to a group as specifically as possible 
- Capitalize Black and White
- LGBTQ+
- Native American
- When discussing size: use “fat positivity” rather than “body positivity”
- With the exception of Millenials, the focus of much of our trend reporting, refer to ages by ranges and numbers rather than generations
- Latin (rather than LatinX or Latino/Latina)
- Genders: Man/men, woman/women, Non-binary, custom (“male/female” is about biological sex, not gender
- Don’t call an individual “diverse” (“This diverse Peruvian millennial”...ick!)
- When using the term “ethnic minorities,” consider if you’re referring to an international or US population. What is an “ethnic minority” isn’t the same in the US and worldwide! 

<br/>

**Tips on how to approach certain topics...**
- Make sure we never sound like we’re recommending or endorsing a diet
- When talking about gender, include multiple options beyond men/women 
- Consider that some nuance can be lost in translation, so follow up with your contact from the international team with questions
- Avoid using “the” in front of a group (“the young,” “the blacks,” “the lesbians,” etc.)
- Rather than referring to someone as able/disabled, refer to a person as “someone with ______”
- Avoid terms like “multicultural,” “diverse,” and “post-racial;” they tend to overpromise
- Make sure photos we choose represent people across genders, races, cultures, shapes and ages (that last one can get left out!)
- Avoid writing “weight loss success stories” when highlighting Pinner stories or advertising use cases. 
-  Instead, frame your story around fitness, health and overall wellness.
  - When writing about health, never use numbers to call out pounds/inches lost, clothing sizes, or calories burned (i.e. “lost 25 pounds,” “used to weigh 250 pounds,.” etc.)

### Legal language

Even when we’re talking in the fine print, we should still be straightforward and conversational.

**How to talk about privacy:** 
Use “private” or “privacy” for personal information issues only. Don’t refer to board settings or posts as “private”—say “secret” instead.

**How to talk about *Pinterest business***
“Pinterest Business” refers to our business marketing programs and channels. It is NOT a master brand for products or partnerships. For example, you’d say “Read the latest updates on the Pinterest Business blog” or “Visit the Pinterest Business page.” You wouldn’t say “Our latest products from Pinterest Business.” In that case, it’s just “Pinterest.” For more information about when to use “Pinterest Business” and when to use “Pinterest,” refer to our brand guidelines.  

**How to use *Pin***:
To protect our trademark for Pin, we have to be thoughtful in how we use the word “Pin” in all of our writing. Within the UI, consider if it might be better to use “Pin” or “idea” for clarity.

- **Write *Pin*:**
  - When someone’s familiar with the UI (lens, tried it…), and “Pin” most accurately describes the functionality
  - When someone is sending a Pin as a message (“Send a Pin to a friend” is clearer than “Send an idea to a friend”)
  - When giving technical advice to businesses (“Upload your Pin” > “Upload your idea”)
<br/>
- **Write *idea*:**
  - When someone is new to Pinterest or may be unfamiliar with what a Pin is (unauthorized page views, activation, many emails and notifications)
  - When explaining what Pinterest is (home feed, unauth, etc.)
<br/>
- **Use a mixture of both *Pin* and *idea*:**
  - When it would be redundant to have the word “idea” repeat multiple times throughout the same surface: Can you mix “idea” and “Pin,” or find ways to reword the copy and CTA so that you don’t need to use either? 

---

### Feature naming

Before you pick a proper name for a new feature, consider if it even needs it. New names clutter up the experience and add to the Pinner’s cognitive load, so the bar for introducing new terminology should be high. Most products/features don't actually need to be called anything (like, "send a Pin" is an action, not a proper Send-a-Pin name).

You can also use a Namestorm document to help develop and present a recommended name.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do examples"/>
     - Consider what’s industry standard
     - Use parallel construction
     - Be clear, conversational and descriptive—feature names should capture what the feature is/does in a way that makes sense to real people
     - Choose a name that works throughout all instances in the interface, across all platforms and contexts 
     - Always use lowercase letters for the new name in UI
     - In longform writing, like if you’re announcing an official product release or writing product tips, follow the capitalization that was used in the launch documentation. Depending on the product, that might be title case (ex: Promoted Video) or it might be sentence case (ex: Save button). 
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't examples"/>
     - Don’t clutter up our experience with confusingly similar terminology (like “recommendations” AND “suggestions”)
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

“Pinterest Business” refers to our business marketing programs and channels. It is NOT a master brand for products or partnerships. For example, you’d say “Read the latest updates on the Pinterest Business blog” or “Visit the Pinterest Business page.” You wouldn’t say “Our latest products from Pinterest Business.” In that case, it’s just “Pinterest.”  

For more information about when to use “Pinterest Business” and when to use “Pinterest,” refer to our brand guidelines.

### Using "inspiration"

*What we mean by “inspiration”:* Ask someone what inspires them, and their mind goes to heroic figures like Olympic athletes or people who’ve overcome great hardships. They don’t usually think of a chicken recipe. But on Pinterest, that’s exactly what counts as inspiring. From small, everyday stuff like chicken recipes, all the way to big-life ideas that get you bicycling across the country or send your career in a new direction. Anything that sparks you to try something new, or think about life in a new way, or spend a meaningful moment with the people you care about—that’s inspiration on Pinterest. 

A little “inspiration” goes a long way: It can be tempting to start peppering “inspiration” across all our experiences (it’s right there in our mission statement!), but much like how we limit the use of Pinterest red in our app and marketing, we don’t splash “inspiration” everywhere. Instead we use it sparingly and thoughtfully.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do examples"/>
     - Good: Use “inspiration” in super high-level descriptions of our company in the press:
        -  Example 1—The inspiration company
        - Example 2—Pinterest is the home of inspiration
     - Even better: Let other people do the describing. When we claim to be “inspirational,” it sounds less believable than it does coming from an outside source. Much better to leave it to the people who actually made Pinterest the go-to spot for inspirational ideas in the first place: Our Pinners!
        - Example 1—Pinner mindset video tagline: “Inspired on Pinterest” 
        - Example 2—Directly quoting Pinners: “I love looking at Pinterest for art inspiration.”
     - Talking to advertisers: A big part of the inspiration people discover on Pinterest comes from businesses. 
     - Example—“Pinterest is a positive place where people get paired with the inspiration to create a life they love—including products, experiences and other inspiration from businesses.”

### Using "you" and "me"

The you/me debate has raged throughout product writing circles for years, and the writing team here at Pinterest had done its own share of epic mulling on the matter.

Where we landed: It’s Pinterest standard to talk to “you” vs. speaking on your behalf (“me”). That’s because Pinterest is all about YOU.

This rule is how we make sure we’re consistently addressing you in the same way across our interface and marketing. Our (now old!) mission = “help you discover and do what you love.” When you first sign up, we ask what topics “you” are into. Recommended Pins are “picked for you” or “inspired by your boards.” And when you search for stuff you saved, you’re looking through “your Pins.”

First person-y lingo is reserved for the rare times when Pinterest speaks on its own behalf (“we found some new ideas for you”).

## UI elements

### Buttons

Buttons should be descriptive but short.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - If your object is already described on the screen, buttons only need a verb
     - If your object isn’t described on the screen, buttons need a verb + the object
     - Use fewer than 3 words
     - Use sentence case
     - Examples:
        - Save
        - Edit profile
        - See job openings
        - Cancel
        - No thanks 
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t use punctuation
     - Examples:
        - Save changes
        - Edit
        - Jobs
        - No, thanks
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

---

### Confirmations and toasts

Confirmations are like little high-fives that let people know that the action they just took was successful. 

Always use a toast, unless there’s another visual indicator that an action’s been taken (for example: if you follow someone there’s an animation showing their icon going into your following tab—so you wouldn’t need a toast there). 

**Elements**
- Header/title: Let the Pinner know the action they just took was successful.
- Subhead/main text: Use if needed, but it’s optional. Ask yourself if a visual element might help more than additional text would.
- Buttons: No buttons in confirmations! 

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Explain what just happened
     - Keep it short and light
     - Include an exclamation point if the toast is under ~4-5 words (even if the toast is a negative action)
     - Examples: 
        - Pin sent!
        - Delete undone!
        - 3 Pins deleted!
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t sound like a robot
     - Don’t include an exclamation point if you say it out loud and it doesn’t sound like something you’d...actually exclaim
        - The action was successful
        - You saved 3 Pins to Uniform
        - We’ll send your feedback to Felicia
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

### Education

Education for a new (or existing!) feature can be a tooltip or a screen takeover, often using progressive disclosure or multiple screens. 

Use the following principles when writing education:

- Set expectations up front about what the new product does
- Guide people to anticipate (and take) next steps—what action will occur after they tap on this button or tab?
- Identify potential questions or points of anxiety about the new product, and give people context and information to feel confident and knowledgeable so they feel confident and comfortable.
- Celebrate a job well done—either with judicious use of positive writing like an exclamation point or “yay,” or some kind of delightful design element.help center

PS: When working with designers on education, consider what education should look like. (Ex: Is a banner being used when just a temporary flyout is needed?) Currently, we have a number of different education design options:
- Tooltip
- Flyout 
- Modal (screen takeover)
- Empty state text
- Banners

---

### Emoji

Okay, okay. We’re loosening up about emoji, since it’s a natural part of human communication. Don’t go crazy and start using, like, flags and onigiri and stuff though. Check out these handy-dandy guidelines:

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Limit emoji to infrequent, one-off elements, like notifications
     - Use extremely common emojis from this list: ❤️, ✔️, 📌, 🔥, ✨, 💡, ⭐️, 📣
     - Use emojis as an addition to the copy, not instead of a word (so “Look who's checking out your Pins  “ rather than “You've got  on your Pins”)
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t use emoji in the product, in permanent parts of the UI
     - Don’t use unique or unusual emojis, even in the name of “delight”
     - Don’t use emojis for negativity (like error messages)
     - Don’t use emoji in an experience where whimsy or delight could be established through existing design assets instead. Check with your designer first!
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

---

### Error messages

Error messages should clearly describe what happened and what the person can do to fix the problem—without overwhelming them with unnecessary info. 

**Elements**

Use titles and text wisely—quickly explain the problem in the title, then follow up with more details
- Title: Let the Pinner know why they’re seeing the error, but keep it short. Include a “Sorry!” or “Oops!” at the beginning to lighten things up a bit. 
  - Sorry is a good fit for when we or our servers screwed up 
  - Oops is a good fit for when we're not sure whether it's us or them (or when it's them)
- Text: Give more details about why they’re seeing the error and how to resolve it if they can. 
- Buttons: A good ol’ [Okay] works in most cases
<br/>
Use red text inline when someone submits a form that’s missing a required field. 
- Don’t use punctuation. Exception: Errors that are more than one sentence or if you want to use an exclamation point

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Use super-simple language
     - Clearly explain what happened
     - Help people fix the problem
     - Be tone-sensitive
     - Limit calls to action—don’t give Pinners too many ways to solve a problem or multiple buttons/steps to work through 
     - If error is a full and complete sentence, use a period at the end
     - Don’t use periods for one-word errors
     - Use conversational, normalizing words like Psst!, Hmm, Oops, and Um
     - Examples: 
        - Choose a board for your Pin and try again.
        - You can't follow this board because this person blocked you. 
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t use emoji in the product, in permanent parts of the UI
     - Don’t use unique or unusual emojis, even in the name of “delight”
     - Don’t use emojis for negativity (like error messages)
     - Don’t use emoji in an experience where whimsy or delight could be established through existing design assets instead. Check with your designer first!
     - Examples: 
        - Parameter 'board_id' is required.
        - You’re not allowed to do that. 
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

---

### Mobile UI

Use mobile-appropriate terms for gestures (ex: swipe and tap, not click), and keep things short.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Tap 
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Click
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

---

### Notifications

Notifications (including push notifications) are lightweight messages that let Pinners know about what’s happening with the Pins they saved, the people they follow and more. 

**Elements**

- Title: No titles in notifications!
- Body: Include up to 3 subjects (ex: Tiffani, Mia and 5 others NOT Tiffani, Mia, Long, Ricky and 17 other people) and keep them to two lines of text, max. 
- Buttons: No buttons in notifications! 

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do examples"/>
     - Mac saved your Pin
     - Sadia invited you to a group board
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't examples"/>
     - Check out what we’re doing for Fashion Week!!!!
     - Based on your search for "dogs,” you’ll love these ideas!  [ Okay ]
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

---

## Syntax and structure

### Parallel structure

When you’re presenting multiple options (ex: bulleted lists, menus), use a similar structure for each item so everything’s easy to scan and understand.  

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Start all items the same way (ex: all verbs, all nouns)
     - Use the same structure (ex: if one option ends in “-ing” then all options should end that way)
     - Examples: 
        - Log out
        - Get help
        - Report a bug
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t use a variety of different structures in the same series
     - Examples: 
        - Log out
        - Help center
        - Report a bug
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

You should also use a parallel structure for multi-screen education punctuation, too. By which we mean: If your education is sentences across three screens, if one of them ends with a period, they all should.

Try this...
- Find new ideas to try. 
- Pinterest is the home of the world’s best ideas. Do you have a free account?
- Sign up for one today.

Not this...
- Find new ideas to try
- Pinterest is the home of the world’s best ideas. Do you have a free account?
- Sign up for one today

See? Just one two-sentence screen turns them all into punctuated screens. However, if all of these were one-phrase screens (Find new ideas to try / Pinterest is the home of the world’s best ideas / Sign up for an account today), no punctuation would be needed. So it goes!

### Addressing people by name

Calling out someone by name can be a very effective way to grab their attention, but it can get old quick. That’s why we do it only sparingly. 

When using the Pinner’s name (or, for that matter, their board’s name) in UI, we recommend you don’t use apostrophes (ex: “Pins from Evany,” not “Evany’s Pins”). There’s too much that can go wrong.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do examples"/>
     - Got it! You won't see Pins from Matt in the future.
     - Want to see a new board from Davy Jones?
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't examples"/>
     - Got it! You won't see Matt's Pins in the future. 
     - See Davy Jones's new board
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

---

### Placeholder text

Also called “ghost text” (whOooOooo), this should be either exemplary (filling in an exact example of what someone would write in the text field) or descriptive (displaying how the function should work or what purpose it serves, if an example would be confusing to the user).

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Use general and realistic (rather than “funny”) example text
     - Open descriptive placeholder text with a verb to immerse people in the action
     - Examples: 
        - www.yoursite.com
        - Add what your board’s about
        - Pick an end date or range of dates 
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Use questions
     - Use the first person
     - Use a one-word placeholder like "Add" that doesn't illustrate the feature's function or value
     - Examples: 
        - www.mysite.com
        - What’s this board about?
        - My board is about bull terriers 
        - June 19, 2002
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

---

### Progressive disclosures

Give people the minimum amount of info they need to complete the task at hand.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Break info into small bites
     - Show info when it’s most helpful
     - Make added details optional, so people who want more info can easily get it, but the experience isn’t cluttered with “in the weeds” details
     - Examples: 
        - Step one (Pin view): See something you want to save for later? Just tap Save.
        - Step two (create board view): You collect your Pins on boards. Make as many as you need!
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t overwhelm people by listing all the possible information they might need up front
     - Examples: 
        - Solo info dialog (Pin view):See something you want to save for yourself? Go ahead and tap Save. Then you’ll need to create a board for your Pin to live on.
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

---

### Referencing the interface

When you’re describing something the Pinner has to do on Pinterest, sometimes it’s helpful to reference the thing they need to click or select.

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - Refer to the elements of the interface only if it isn’t otherwise clear what you’re talking about
     - Use menu and button (and occasionally icon)
     - Examples: 
        - Use + to add a Pin
        - Select Log out from the menu
        - Type in your search
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - Don’t describe the interface element unless it’s absolutely necessary for clarity—for more details, see our full list of terms
     - Don’t use words like “click” or “tap” if possible, or assume universal accessibility
     - Examples: 
        - Select the “+” button to add a Pin
        - Select Log out from the dropdown menu
        - Click here to begin your search
  </Group>
</TwoCol>
---

### Rhetorical questions

Avoid them, unless it’s the shortest and most direct way to get the message across (ex: in a confirmation toast). For a gut-check, ask yourself: “Would I actually say this out loud?” The answer’s probably “nah.”

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do examples"/>
     - Delete group board
     - Enjoy!
     - Keep scrolling to see more
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't examples"/>
     - How about deleting this group board?
     - Are we having fun yet?
     - Want more Pinterest?
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

### Settings

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>

### Specific verbs

In UI writing, sometimes it’s hard to choose between two seemingly similar verbs. Here are some tips:

**Pick vs. choose vs. select:**
Pick and choose sound more conversational in en_US/UK, and should always be used when discussing taste (“Pick your favorite topics!”) or other more human concepts. If you’re thinking about saying “choose,” try “pick” instead (unless you’re trying to avoid monotony). 

*Pick:*
- Pick 5 topics you love

<br/>

**See vs. view:**
View derives from some action on the user's part (choosing filters, say) and See comes from work Pinterest’s already done for the user (like providing additional search results/related Pins).

*See:*
- Come see! (tooltip on more ideas tabs)
- See ideas trending in Hounds (email notif)

*View:*
- View your map (map button CTA)
- View in chronological order (made up filter sort)

### Tenses

Use the [present perfect](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/present-perfect-continuous-tense/) tense in UI writing, even when using a contraction seems more conversational. 

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do"/>
     - You have a new follower
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't"/>
     - You've got a new follower
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

### Pin puns

We all love a good Pin pun, but unfortunately, they don’t translate very well. We save Pin puns for internal comms, but don’t use them in external language or content.
