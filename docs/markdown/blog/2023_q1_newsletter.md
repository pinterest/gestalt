## Components and tokens

### Featured component: Mobile modal

We plan to vastly improve Gestalt’s support for the mobile web experience in 2023. Our first step towards that goal was the creation of a mWeb adaptive version of Modal. This new feature within Modal makes it easier to build features that gracefully adapt from desktop to mobile devices. This work should lead to more consistent experiences in our mobile web product built with less code in less time.

### Toast and Badge updates
<ImgContainer src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/8b/84/338b84c2f282d39a9fe20dcf7b3b9622.png" alt="a small red button that says Save" />
We’ve been working behind the scenes to ship refinements to Toast and Badge on our Web platform. After successful experiments, we’re excited to announce they’ve both been officially shipped to Gestalt. Toast is now slimmer, meaning less of the screen is occluded when it’s displayed. On the opposite end, Badge now slightly larger due to a higher font size. 

Subtle as these changes may seem, we expect to see some serious usability gains from these updates.

### New PopoverEducational component

The new PopverEducational component represents our continued focus on making Gestalt more opinionated. In the past, displaying in-product education required a decent amount of configuration of our existing Popover to follow our standards. This led to more work and more opportunities for accidental inconsistencies. 

PopoverEducation removes the overhead by being purpose-built to support in-product education with less configuration and headaches.

### New HelpButton component
<ImgContainer src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/8b/84/338b84c2f282d39a9fe20dcf7b3b9622.png" alt="a small red button that says Save" />
Speaking of opinionated components, we added a small-but-mighty component called HelpButton. This component is intended to make it just that much easier to provide help/guidance at the individual element level. 

We shipped this component on the early side, meaning we think there’s room for improvement, but we’ve confident that it’ll be a major help and worth going out the door. We look forward to sharing more HelpButton-related updates in the future.

### 20+ new icons
<ImgContainer src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6e/da/6b/6eda6b3f5412607b31d58446b97d57c1.png" alt="a large red button that says Save"/>
Who doesn’t like more icons? The answer (backed by science) is no one. We continue to work on improving parity between our design icon library and what’s in code. There’s still room for improvement, but we’ve filled in 20+ gaps this quarter. 

Check out our Icon library if you’re interested in seeing the full list of icons we currently support in code.

### Form guidelines

Our biggest documentation update for the quarter was the addition of Form guidelines to our documentation. Forms can be super tricky. Our goal with these guidelines is to take the mystery out of creating effective forms with Gestalt while also beginning to suss out our official point of view on the subject.

### Added keywords to our icon library

OK, we’ll fess up. Finding the icon you’re looking for in Gestalt is not great. We know it’s a pain and we plan to fix it. Our first step towards that goal is the addition of search keywords for each icon in our Icon library. For example, searching for “notifications” will return the Bell icon.

This is the first step in what we hope will be a slew of improvements to Gestalt’s iconography and the know-how on how to use it.

### Updates to Android Icon and IconButton component docs
<ImgContainer src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/8b/84/338b84c2f282d39a9fe20dcf7b3b9622.png" alt="a small red button that says Save" />
As we ramp up development of mobile component development (yes, it’s happening), we’re trying something new by adding design specifications straight into our documentation. You can see this in action with our Android Icon and IconButton component docs. 

The goal of this work is to speed up component development by making our docs even more of a source of truth.
