## Accessibility

Ensure AvatarGroup have labels describing both the data presented and the call to action in case of icon buttons.

People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size, to personalize how they interact with their devices. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and documentation about accessibility for iOS:
