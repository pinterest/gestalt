## Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
<Group>
<Do title="When to use" />
- Any time succinct data needs to be entered by a user, like a date, email address, name or Pin title.

</Group>
<Group>
<Dont title="When not to use" />
- Situations where long amounts of text need to be entered, since the full inputted text of the TextField could be truncated. Use [TextArea](/web/textarea) instead.

## Best practices
For general text field best practices, refer to the [Web Text Field Documentation](/web/textfield).

<Do title="Do" />
Use helper text for important information. Helper text helps users understand how to complete the text field or to indicate any needed input.

## Accessibility

People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size to personalize how they interact with their device. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and documentation about accessibility for iOS:

[Accessible design on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility/overview/introduction/)
[Accessible development on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/ios/)


### Labels
Be sure to provide a unique label for each TextField.


### Validation
When providing a validation message, make sure the instructions are clear and help users complete the field. For example, "Passwords must contain at least 20 characters". Additional helpful information could be, indicating which input is needed, describing allowed formats, timing limitations, etc.
These practices give users of assistive technologies more information about the form, helping them to fill it out.


### Keyboards
Make sure your keyboards match the function of your form field. For example, asking for a phone number should pull up the phone pad keyboard.

## Variants
1. **With helper text**
Whenever you want to provide more information about a form field, you should use helper text.
2. **Disabled**
Disabled Text Fields can't be interacted with. They also don't need to meet contrast requirements, so don't use them to present info to the user.
3. **Error**
Text Field can display an error message below the field. Always include an icon to illustrate the error by more than just color.
4. **Success**
Text Field can display a success message below the field. Always include an icon to illustrate the success by more than just color.
