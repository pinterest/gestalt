## Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
<Group>
<Do title="When to use"/>
- Use as symbolic communication for elements that do not have room for text. In this case, ensure the icon choice is easily recognizable and makes sense to international users.
- To help with quick scanning by adding rhythm and hierarchy to the design

</Group>
<Group>
<Dont title="When not to use" />
- For decorative purposes or visual embellishment, like how you would use an illustration. Contact us if this is needed.
- As a visual reinforcement for associated text without adding new meaning
- To communicate status or health. Use Status instead.
- As an interactive element (e.g., hover, focus, click/tap). Use [IconButton](/ios/iconbutton) instead.
</Group>

## Best practices

- If your icons are interactive, use the IconButton component and ensure that they utilize at least 44 x 44px touch targets
- When designing in iOS and Android, use platform-specific icons as they are most recognizable to that platform’s users
- When possible, include a visible text label
- Icons should always be a solid color and should inherit the color of the surrounding text if applicable

For general Icon best practices, refer to the web [Icon documentation](/web/icon).

## Accessibility

People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size, to personalize how they interact with their devices. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and documentation about accessibility for iOS:

[Accessible design on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility/overview/introduction/)

## Anatomy

### Dimensions

Icon's container dimensions are the same for all icons regardless of the size of the vector asset inside of the container.

### Touch target

If an icon is interactive, use the built-in 44 x 44px touch target.

## Variants

### Size

Generally 16px and 24px icons should be used in mobile interfaces. When icons are interactive, they should use the IconButton component with its built-in 44 x 44px touch target.

### Size use cases

1. **12px**
   Used only for Pins and Boards
2. **16px**
   Default icon size. Used often, whenever an icon is needed, i.e., icons in headers, close icons, etc.
3. **20px**
   Used only when pairing with 16pt (Size200) text
4. **24px**
   Used for navigation bar elements or when a larger icon is needed
5. **32px**
   Used sparingly to draw attention to an icon that might otherwise be missed

### Color

Icon colors are semantic—they have a specific meaning and aren't arbitrary. There is no disabled color for icons, as that is handled by the button state that an icon is in.

### Platform-specific icons

1. **Share**
   On iOS, use the icon-share icon to indicate the ability to share an element.
2. **Check**
   Instead of a radio button on iOS, use the check icon.
3. **Back**
   On iOS, use the chevron icon titled arrow-back to indicate backward movement.

## Naming

- Follow the [web icon naming convention](http://pinch.pinadmin.com/new-icon-naming) when possible
- Names should be kebab-case: all lowercase, with multiple words separated by a dash
- Start with the primary function first&mdash;instead of `circle-arrow`, use `arrow-circle`

## Writing

<TwoCol>
<Group>
<Do title="Do" />
- Use a descriptive label to describe the icon
- Be succinct. Exclude unnecessary words.
- Be informative and accurate
- Write in the active voice
- Avoid technical jargon

</Group>

<Group>
<Dont title="Don't" />
- Use the words "image" or "icon" in the description label; instead, use words that indicate the icon's purpose
