## Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="When to use" />
    - Showing all the available options at one glance
    - Arranging a group of buttons in a horizontal or vertical stack due to limited space
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="When not to use" />
     - Switching between different views. Use [Tabs](/ios/tabs) instead
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

## Mobile best practices

Keep primary actions (ex: submitting a form) on the right and secondary actions (ex: cancel) on the left. When used vertically, keep the primary action at the top.

For general Button best practices on color usage and states, refer to the [Button documentation](/ios/button).

## Accessibility

People use iOS's accessibility features, such as TalkBack and dynamic text sizing to personalize how they interact with their devices. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Material Design and development documentation about accessibility for Android:

1. **lg (60px)**
   Large should be primarily used on Pinner, business and internal surfaces.
2. **sm (48px)**
   Small should be used sparingly and only in places where the UI is very dense.

## Styling

For information on color, icons, roles, and states, refer to the [Button documentation](/ios/button).

## Writing

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
    - If your object is already described on the screen, Buttons only need a verb (Example: Save).
    - If your object isn’t described on the screen, Buttons need a verb + the object (Example: Create Pin).
    - Use fewer than 3 words.
    - Use sentence case.
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't" />
    - Do not use punctuation.
  </Group>
</TwoCol>
For writing best practices, refer to the [web Button documentation](/web/button).

## Localization

For RTL (right-to-left) languages, the layout of the button group is mirrored. the primary button will be on the left and top and the secondary button will be on the right and bottom.
