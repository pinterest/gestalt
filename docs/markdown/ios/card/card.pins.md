## Fixed preview

Card.Pins with a fixed preview communicates that the entire preview area is a tap target. It is used when the goal is to direct Pinners to a single destination (e.g. topical Pin feed) where they can scan a breadth of and/or compare related ideas.

### Fixed: Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
<Group>
<Do title="When to use"/>
- To recommend a single landing experience containing related Pins (e.g. topical Pin feed, more ideas for your board) to a user based on their engagement, interests, boards, demographic information or other signals

</Group>
<Group>
<Dont title="When not to use" />
- To suggest Pins that are not related or within a defined grouping
- When recommending more than one landing experience (e.g. 2 or more topical Pin feeds)
- When the goal is to direct Pinners to a specific place in a destination (e.g. a slot position within a stream).
</Group>
</TwoCol>

### Fixed: Best practices

<TwoCol>
<Group>
<Do title="Do"/>
- All images should be equal in size, whether 2up, 3up or 4up
- The entire Card.Pins preview block is a single tap target that directs Pinners to a single destination

</Group>
<Group>
<Dont title="Don't" />
- Make each image its own tap target. The entire Card.Pins preview block should be a single tap target.

### Fixed: Accessibility

People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size, to personalize how they interact with their devices. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and documentation about accessibility for iOS:

## Scrolling preview

Card.Pins with a scrolling preview communicates that each preview is an individual tap target that all lead to the same destination (e.g. every preview takes you to a specific slot position within a stream).

Use scrolling preview when the user goal is best supported by focusing them on one Pin at a time.

### Scrolling: Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
<Group>
<Do title="When to use"/>
- To present multiple entry points into a single destination containing Pins (e.g. stream)
- When the user goal is best supported by focusing the user on one Pin at a time (e.g. watching videos in a related stream, evaluating Pins with a high intent mindset)

</Group>
<Group>
<Dont title="When not to use"/>
- When each tap target leads to a different destination (e.g. different streams)
- When the goal is to direct Pinners to a landing experience that displays more than one Pin (e.g. a topical Pin feed).
</Group>
</TwoCol>

### Scrolling: Best practices

<TwoCol>
<Group>
<Do title="Do"/>
- Flex Pin previews to different common aspect ratios so that the best dimensions can be used to preview different media types
- Flex Pin previews to different sizes to support various levels of visual prominence
- Make all images within the preview block equal in size
- Use a single tap target for each preview within the preview block that leads to the same destination

</Group>
<Group>
<Dont title="Don't" />
- Make the entire scrolling preview block a single tap target. Each Pin preview should be an individual tap target.
