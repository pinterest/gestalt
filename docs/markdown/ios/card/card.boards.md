<Do title="When to use"/>
- To suggest boards containing content that a Pinner might like based on their engagement, interests, boards, demographic information, or other signals
- To suggest boards created by another user (ex: Pinner, company, brand)
- To suggest boards featuring a Pin(s) the user has saved/looked at

<Dont title="When not to use" />
- When showing any content that is not contained within a Card.Boards

</TwoCol>

## Best practices

- Always show two boards or sections per card. More or less than two will display inconsistently within the card. 
- Use any variations of the Board and Section component besides CTAs. Board CTAs can interfere with the selection of the card itself. 

For general Card.Board best practices, refer to the [Board and Section documentation in Figma](http://pinch.pinadmin.com/board_and_section_figma).
