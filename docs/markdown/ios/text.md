    <Dont title="Don't" />
    Use overly long headings. If headings are dynamically generated (like a 3rd party app name), truncation will work after 2 lines, but be mindful of unintended changes in meaning.

## Accessibility

### Minimum text size

A minimum text size of 16pt is recommended for readability, especially for longer blocks of text. Some short text labels or secondary text can go lower than that, but smaller sizes should be kept to a minimum. Making text brief will also help with readability.

### Dynamic Type sizes for accessibility

As users scale text with Accessibility settings, sizes should scale according to iOS defaults. Our text sizes when Accessibility settings are turned on are below.

### Native features
People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size, to personalize how they interact with their devices. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and documentation about accessibility for iOS:

[Accessible design on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility/overview/introduction/)
[Accessible development on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/ios/)

## Size

These font sizes follow those available through our [Typography scale](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/foundations/typography/guidelines#Scale)
<br/>

### Dynamic Type sizes

This is how text scales when people resize text. Our default text sizes correspond to iOS Large sizes. For more info, see [iOS Dynamic Type sizes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/typography/#specifications)
<br/>

<iframe style={{border:0}} width="100%" height="436" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FAHcKJDgb7E7YswlgW1wY8E%2FGestalt-for-iOS%3Fnode-id%3D20539%253A76626%26t%3DGzMOAn3V49oVC2MG-1" allowFullScreen></iframe>

## Weight
For emphasizing text in body copy and in sizes below 16pt and below, use `bold`. For titles and headings, use `semibold`.
<br/>

<iframe style={{border:0}} width="100%" height="477" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FAHcKJDgb7E7YswlgW1wY8E%2FGestalt-for-iOS%3Fnode-id%3D20532%253A76157%26t%3DGzMOAn3V49oVC2MG-1" allowFullScreen></iframe>

## Alignment

Text can either be start, center or end aligned. Text can be forced to left or right align when aligning integers in tables.
<br/>

## Colors

You can specify which color you want for your text. Most colors automatically change between light and dark modes, but the `light` and `dark` properties are available when light or dark colors are specifically desired. An example is using the dark mode error color on a dark background in light mode.

## Styles

Text can be italicized for emphasis, or underlined to denote a link.

## Overflow and truncation

For general guidelines around text truncation, see [Typography Best practices](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/foundations/typography/guidelines#Best-practices)

## Writing

<TwoCol>
<Group>
<Do title="Do" />
- Keep text in UI short and clear
- Use **Sentence** case for all text that isn’t a brand name or proper noun
</Group>
 <Group>
<Dont title="Don't" />
- Use long text labels that could end up truncating or causing space issues when translating to other languages
- Use Title Case or ALL CAPS in UI labels
- Use ALL CAPS for paragraph text unless referring to a product or other entity that uses that style
- Punctuate headings unless they are posing a question or making an exclamation
</Group>
</TwoCol>

## Localization

Keep text simple and short to avoid truncation or line-wrapping in UI controls like buttons when translating languages that require more characters. Avoid overriding our line-height settings, as this can result in text clipping for scripts, like Hindi, that have taller ascenders and descenders.

### Right-to-left (RTL) alignment

When translated to languages that read from right to left, ensure that paragraph text is aligned based on language not on context. For example, if the UI is reversed for an RTL language like Arabic, but there is a block of text in an LTR language such as English, left-align the paragraph in English.

    <Dont title="Don't" />
  </Group>
</TwoCol>


However, for lists or items in a menu, maintain the alignment of the UI.

    <Dont title="Don't" />
  </Group>
  </TwoCol>

### Text-wrapping and hyphenation

Hyphenation on iOS is turned off by default to avoid incorrect word breaks when strings of text wrap to the next line. This is especially helpful for international languages where an incorrect word break can greatly change the meaning of a word or sentence.
