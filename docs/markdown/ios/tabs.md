## Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="When to use" />
      - To break up a large collection of information or pages into logical, digestible views.
      - To switch between different, yet related views, such as Updates and Messages.
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="When not to use" />
    - Any UI elements above the Tabs are altered upon selection. Use [Link](/web/link) instead. 
    - To break up chunks of information that aren't related to each other or aren't on the same hierarchical level. 
    - To filter information. Consider [SegmentedControl](/web/segmentedcontrol) instead.
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

## Best practices

- Place Tabs directly above the relevant information.
- Avoid using more than six Tabs. Consider using a different component like [Sheet](/android/sheet).
- Order Tabs by relevance—the first tab should be the most logical starting view.

## Accessibility

People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size to personalize how they interact with their device. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and documentation about accessibility for iOS:

## Variants

### Alignment

Tabs can be aligned to either the start or end point depending on language direction or centered.

1. **Start or end aligned (Default)**
Use if you have more than three tabs. Start or end-aligned tabs will scroll horizontally if information is long enough to flow out of the frame.
2. **Center aligned**
This variant may be used if you have two or three tabs. Center-aligned Tabs shouldn't be used if labels are long or if you have more than three Tabs. The center-aligned style of Tabs is used primarily for navigational Tabs and sits in the header of the screen.
