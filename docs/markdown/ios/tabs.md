## Usage guidelines

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="When to use" />
      - To break up a large collection of content into logical, digestible views.
      - To switch between different, yet related views, such as Updates and Messages.
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="When not to use" />
    - When any UI or content above the Tabs is altered upon selection. Use Link instead. 
    - To break up content that is not related to each other or is not on the same hierarchical level. 
    - To filter content. Consider SegmentedControl instead.
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

## Best practices

- Place Tabs directly above the relevant content. 
- Avoid using more than 6 Tabs. Consider using a different component like Sheet.
- Order Tabs by relevance - the first tab should be the most logical starting view.

    <Dont title="Don't" />
    Hide or disable Tabs if that Tab’s content is empty. Additionally, there should always be at least two tabs.

## Accessibility

People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size to personalize how they interact with their device. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and documentation about accessibility for iOS:

[Accessible design on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility/overview/introduction/)
[Accessible development on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/ios/)

## Variants

### Alignment

Tabs can be aligned to either the start or end point depending on language direction or centered.

1. **Start or end aligned (Default)**
Use if you have more than three tabs. Start or end aligned tabs will scroll horizontally if content is long enough to flow out of the frame. 
2. **Center aligned**
This variant may be used if you have two or three tabs. Center aligned Tabs should not be used if labels are long or if you have more than three Tabs. The center-aligned style of Tabs is used primarily for navigational Tabs and sits in the header of the screen.

This is the default tab style. Use the filled style for any Tabs that sit within a screen.

### Animation

By default, the Tabs content swipes in either from the left or right, depending on the way you are tabbing. Visit Apple’s HIG for more information on [Animation and Motion](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/animation/).
