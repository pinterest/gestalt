title: IconButtonFloating
description: IconButtonFloating represents the primary or most common action on the screen. As the name suggests, it floats over the content and is always on top of everything on the screen. Similar to IconButton, the floating version uses icons instead of text to convey available actions. However, it is used when the action needs to be visible at all times in a sticky way where content can scroll underneath. IconButtonFloating remains in place on scroll.

**Please note**: Icons on IconButtonFloating have a limited range of colors and sizes compared to regular icons, as they are different components and have particular usage cases. See Icon for additional information.

## Anatomy

IconButtonFloating uses icons instead of text to convey available actions on a screen. Some buttons are specialized for particular tasks, such as navigation or presenting menus. Icons(.svg viewbox) dimensions are the same for all icons regardless of the size of the vector asset inside of the container. See [Icon](/ios/icon) for more information.

## Writing

For writing best practices, refer to the [content standards](/foundations/content_standards/ui_elements).

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
    - Use a descriptive label to describe the IconButtonFloating action by beginning with a verb
  </Group>
  <Group>
    <Dont title="Don't" />
    - Use the words "image" or "icon" in the description label. Instead, prefer to use verbs that describe the action, e.g. "Save" or "Edit"
  </Group>
