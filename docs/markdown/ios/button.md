## Best practices

- Place primary buttons to the right or top of other buttons when in a button group.
- Keep elements inside a button container grouped. Label text and icons should remain centered when the Button width increases.
- Avoid using multiple button sizes in the same experience.
- If necessary, adjust the button placement and size when scaling from large screens to small screens.

For general Button best practices, refer to the [Button web documentation](/web/button).

## Variants

### Size

Mobile buttons are available in 2 sizes. The Button text always use [$font-size-300 token](/foundations/design_tokens#Font-size) (16pt).

1. **lg (60pt)**
   Large should be primarily used on Pinner, business and internal surfaces.
2. **sm (44pt)**
   Small should be used sparingly and only in places where the UI is very dense.

### Width

1. **Inline (default)**
   Inline is our default button width. The width of an inline Button is based on the length of its text. Use in most cases where you need a Button.
2. **Full-width (fullWidth)**
   Full-width Buttons can be used in narrower content areas when the text in the Button is close to full width in the content area.

## Accessibility

People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size to personalize how they interact with their device. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and API documentation about accessibility for iOS:

- [Accessible design on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/accessibility/)
- [Accessible development on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/)

## Localization

For RTL (right-to-left) languages, the layout of the button is mirrored. The icon is placed on the right side of the text.
