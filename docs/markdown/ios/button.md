<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="When to use" />
    - Communicating an action that will occur.
    - Triggering or enabling an action, such as submitting requested information.
    - Progressing or regressing a user through a step in a flow.
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="When not to use" />
    - Directing users to a new page or different part within the same page.
    - Limited space available. Consider using an IconButton instead.
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

## Best practices

- Place primary buttons to the right or top of other buttons when in a button group.
- Keep elements inside a button container grouped. Label text and icons should remain centered when the Button width increases.
- Avoid using multiple button sizes in the same experience.
- If necessary, adjust the button placement and size when scaling from large screens to small screens.

For general Button best practices, refer to the [Button web documentation](/web/button).

## Accessibility

People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size to personalize how they interact with their device. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and API documentation about accessibility for iOS:

## Variants

### Size

Mobile buttons are available in 2 sizes. The Button text always use [$font-size-300 token](/foundations/design_tokens#Font-size) (16sp).

1. **lg (60px)**
   Large should be primarily used on Pinner, business and internal surfaces.
2. **sm (44px)**
   Small should be used sparingly and only in places where the UI is very dense.

### Width

1. **Inline (default)**
   Inline is our default button width. The width of an inline Button is based on the length of its text. Use in most cases where you need a Button.
2. **Full-width (fullWidth)**
   Full-width Buttons can be used in narrower content areas when the text in the Button is close to full width in the content area.

3. **Gray (Secondary)**

   Used to block user interaction such as hover, focus and click. Disabled Buttons are completely unreachable by a keyboard and screenreader, so do not attach Tooltips to disabled Buttons.
2. **Selected**

## Writing
<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
    - If your object is already described on the screen, Buttons only need a verb (Example: Save).
    - If your object isn’t described on the screen, Buttons need a verb + the object (Example: Create Pin).
    - Use fewer than 3 words.
    - Use sentence case.
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't" />
    - Do not use punctuation.
  </Group>
</TwoCol>
For writing best practices, refer to the [web Button documentation](/web/button).

## Localization

For RTL (right-to-left) languages, the layout of the button is mirrored. The icon is placed on the right side of the text.
