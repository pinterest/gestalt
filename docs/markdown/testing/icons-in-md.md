## Iconography design principles:

Think about the principles you need to follow in your design work.

**Obvious**
Icons are simple, modern, friendly, and easily recognizable. Each icon is consolidated to its minimal form, expressing fundamental aspects.

**Steady**
Icon shapes are bold and geometric, presenting a consistent look across surfaces. Make sure icons feel balanced, and align elements optically.

**Accessible**
Icons should present a graphical shape that ensures readability and clearness, even at small sizes. In addition, icons should be understandable by a global audience of users, regardless of nationality or language.

## Pros/cons of iconography in product

1. [UIE](https://www.uie.com/) conducted two experiments to test how people use icons. First they changed the pictures of icons in a toolbar but kept them in the same location. People quickly adapted to this change. Afterwards, they kept the images but shuffled their location in the toolbar. This change confused the participants and caused problems for them.
2. [Michael Zuschlag](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zuschlogin.com%2F%3Fp%3D47&t=OGVjNWQ3MzAxNDE5NDY2MDY0MmNlMmY2YjI3MDE5YjBmY2JhMjE2MixHTlZ6Skd3Tg%3D%3D&b=t%3AfIR3gaVrEcGakJWUzP9Grg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fuxmyths.com%2Fpost%2F715009009%2Fmyth-icons-enhance-usability&m=1) says that “icons contrary to intuition, do not necessarily help the user find a menu item better than a text label alone. It’s not worth it.” He also discusses his views on [UX Exchange](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fux.stackexchange.com%2Fquestions%2F5084%2Fbest-practice-for-navigation-usability&t=ZWNhODhlZDU4NzZlZjEyZjQ1OTc0OWJhNDUwY2M3YjQyZTUyMDBlNyxHTlZ6Skd3Tg%3D%3D&b=t%3AfIR3gaVrEcGakJWUzP9Grg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fuxmyths.com%2Fpost%2F715009009%2Fmyth-icons-enhance-usability&m=1).
3. The former icon-only toolbar in Microsoft Outlook had poor usability and changing the icons and their positioning didn’t help much. The introduction of text labels next to the icons immediately fixed the usability issues and people started to use the toolbar. Another test revealed people remember a button’s position instead of the graphic interpretation of the function. —[The Importance Of Labels](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.msdn.com%2Fjensenh%2Farchive%2F2005%2F11%2F01%2F487661.aspx&t=OTZiZDM5NTU2YmMwMWUwYzE0YmZjMmJhMjYzNDE5MzM4ZWJjNGM5MixHTlZ6Skd3Tg%3D%3D&b=t%3AfIR3gaVrEcGakJWUzP9Grg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fuxmyths.com%2Fpost%2F715009009%2Fmyth-icons-enhance-usability&m=1)
4. A user’s understanding of an icon is based on previous experience. Due to the absence of a standard usage for most icons, text labels are necessary to communicate the meaning and reduce ambiguity. —[Icon Usability](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nngroup.com%2Farticles%2Ficon-usability%2F&t=ZmNiNDQ0YWMyYzY5YmQyNTliMDhhOTFmNzYzNjA2NjE4ZGZjYTRlMixHTlZ6Skd3Tg%3D%3D&b=t%3AfIR3gaVrEcGakJWUzP9Grg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fuxmyths.com%2Fpost%2F715009009%2Fmyth-icons-enhance-usability&m=1)
5. In the battle of clarity between icons and labels, labels always win. —[Labels always win.](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbokardo.com%2Farchives%2Flabels-always-win%2F&t=NjE5ZjI3NDQ5NzVmN2UzZDdiOTM4ODZlMDJmY2MzNDA5YjE2NWY0NyxHTlZ6Skd3Tg%3D%3D&b=t%3AfIR3gaVrEcGakJWUzP9Grg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fuxmyths.com%2Fpost%2F715009009%2Fmyth-icons-enhance-usability&m=1)
6. “When in doubt, always remember this: [the best icon is a text label.](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fthomasbyttebier.be%2Fblog%2Fthe-best-icon-is-a-text-label&t=MDBiOGE4Yjg5NmFkYzJjODUyZGVmMzQ1N2YwNjAwZDRhNDk5OWExOCxHTlZ6Skd3Tg%3D%3D&b=t%3AfIR3gaVrEcGakJWUzP9Grg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fuxmyths.com%2Fpost%2F715009009%2Fmyth-icons-enhance-usability&m=1)”
7. [Don Normann](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jnd.org%2Fdn.mss%2Fapples_products_are.html&t=ZjhjOTJlMjQwZmQxNzcwMTk1NWUxNTlkMzU0MDViYzQ5ZWRmMGM4MCxHTlZ6Skd3Tg%3D%3D&b=t%3AfIR3gaVrEcGakJWUzP9Grg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fuxmyths.com%2Fpost%2F715009009%2Fmyth-icons-enhance-usability&m=1) says that “Inscrutable icons litter the face of the [Apple] devices even though the research community has long demonstrated that people cannot remember the meaning of more than a small number of icons. Icon plus label is superior to icon alone or label alone. Who can remember what each icon means? Not me.
8. In [another study](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uie.com%2Fbrainsparks%2F2006%2F02%2F20%2Forbitz-cant-get-a-date%2F&t=NzE4NGYyNDEyMWU3OTJlZmEzMjc3MmNkZjA1MTU0ZjY4NzZhODg3YyxHTlZ6Skd3Tg%3D%3D&b=t%3AfIR3gaVrEcGakJWUzP9Grg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fuxmyths.com%2Fpost%2F715009009%2Fmyth-icons-enhance-usability&m=1), the team of UIE observed that people remember a button’s position instead of the graphic interpretation of the function.

The **benefits of icons** in a graphical user interface (GUI) include:
(source: [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/))

- Icons make good targets: they are typically sized large enough to be **easily touched** in a[finger-operated UI](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mouse-vs-fingers-input-device/), but also work well with a mouse cursor (in contrast to words, which can suffer from [read–tap asymmetry](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/touch-target-size/)on touch screens).
- Yet they save space: icons can be **compact** enough to allow toolbars, palettes, and so on to display many icons in a relatively small space.
- Icons are **fast to recognize** at a glance (if well designed) — particularly true for standard icons that people have seen and used before.
- There is **no need to translate** icons for [international users](https://www.nngroup.com/topic/international-users/), provided that the icons are mindful of cultural differences (for example, mailboxes look very different in various countries whereas envelopes look the same, therefore an envelope is a more international icon for an email program than a mailbox).
- Icons can be **visually pleasing** and enhance the aesthetic appeal of a design.
- They support the notion of a **product family** or suite when the same icons and style are used in several places.

Despite these potential advantages, icons often cause usability problems when they are designed without consideration for their many potential downsides.

**Lack of Purpose**
Before including any design element, it is critical to ask this primary question: “Do I need this?”. If it doesn’t immediately assist you in achieving your goal, don’t include it. If it helps, think of your site as a movie script. You have limited words, limited time, and limited space within which to command your audience’s attention and to communicate your point. Do not squander these valuable resources on unnecessary flourishes.

**“Universal” Icons Are Rare**
There are a few icons that enjoy mostly universal recognition from users. The icons for home, print, and the [magnifying glass for search](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/magnifying-glass-icon/) are such instances. Outside of these examples, most icons continue to be ambiguous to users due to their association with different meanings across various interfaces. This **absence of a standard hurts the adoption of an icon** over time, as users cannot rely on it having the same functionality every time it is encountered.

## When & when not to use icons within the product

**When to use**

- As symbolic communication for elements that do not have room for text, like the number of pins in a carousel. In this case, ensure the icon choice is easily recognizable and makes sense to international users.
- To convey a critical meaning that cannot be communicated with words, like a downward chevron in a Button to indicate it reveals a menu.
- To help with quick scanning by adding rhythm and hierarchy to the design.

**When NOT to use**

- For purposes that are decorative or for visual embellishment, such as how illustrations are typically used. Contact us if this is needed.
- As a visual reinforcement for associated text, without adding new meaning.
- To communicate status or health. Use [Status](https://gestalt.netlify.app/status) instead.
- As an interactive element (e.g., utilizing hover, focus, click/tap). Use [IconButton](https://gestalt.netlify.app/iconbutton) instead.

## Best practices

**Do**

- Use icons intentionally, ensuring the Icon choice is easily recognizable and makes sense in the context.
- Pair text and icons when possible to provide better clarity.
- Do center-align icons when they’re next to text.
- Do match your icon color with your text color when pairing them.

**Dont**

- Repurpose icons. Using icons for their intended meaning supports good comprehension.
- Don't create interactive Icons using TapArea. Use [IconButton](https://gestalt.netlify.app/iconbutton) instead.
- Don’t baseline-align icons to the text.
- Don’t use different colors for text and icons.

**Tips for Designing with Icons**

If you decide to include icons in your interface, **do your research first**! Familiarize yourself with **icons used by other competitors** and with icons commonly used **on the platforms**, as those will be most recognizable to your users.

If you must design new icons, strive to make them easy to recognize and memorize by following these guidelines:

- Keep the design **simple and schematic**. Reduce the amount of graphic details by focusing on the basic characteristics of the object rather than creating a highly realistic image in order to speed up recognition. (Intricate details are difficult to distinguish at smaller sizes.)
- Use the**5-second rule**: if it takes you more than 5 seconds to think of an appropriate icon for something, it is unlikely that an icon can effectively communicate that meaning.
- [Test the icons for recognizability](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-testing/): ask people what they expect the icons to stand for.
- **Test the icons for memorability**: ask a repeat set of users if they can remember the icon’s meaning after being told what it represented a couple weeks earlier.

## Icon sizing

These are the guidelines for icon sizes (in px):
12
Used sparingly in tight spaces. When possible, use a text label next to the icon, as it can be hard to see for visually impaired people.
14
Used often following body text content any time an icon is needed.
16
Used often any time an icon is needed. Default icon size.
24
Used frequently any time an icon is needed.
32
Used occasionally, on more dense UI.
32+
Should be used sparingly and only in places where the UI is very dense and a larger icon is required.

**Touch targets**
All touch targets for interactive icons need to be 44px or larger. Engineers can add padding to a touch target to meet the 44px requirement.

## Icon color

Icons can be created using the following color options. brandPrimary should only be used to represent the Pinterest logo, as it is not accessible. See the [design tokens](https://gestalt.netlify.app/design_tokens#Text-color) for more info.

## Icon themes

**Stroke and fill**
Filled icons are our standard icons. They should be used as much as possible on product UI, as they reinforce readability and accessibility standards.

**Outlined icons**
Outlined icons present a light and clear visual and should be used only on dense layouts supporting to balance the content. In addition, the stroke weight should be consistent across platforms.
Don't mix outlined with filled icons, as it can be hard to scan and creates visual inconsistency.

[Case study for reference](https://www.viget.com/articles/are-hollow-icons-really-harder-to-recognize-a-research-study/)

## Writing

**Do**
Use a descriptive label to describe the Icon

- Be succinct. Exclude unnecessary words.
- Be informative and accurate
- Write in the active voice
- Avoid technical jargon

**Dont**
Use the words "image" or "icon" in the description label; instead, use words that indicate the purpose of the icon.

## When & when not to use labels/tooltips in conjunction with an icon

(source: [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/))

To help overcome the ambiguity that almost all icons face, a **text label must be present alongside an icon** to clarify its meaning in that particular context. (And even if you’re using a standard icon, it’s often safer to include a label, especially if you slightly altered the icon to match your aesthetic preferences or constraints.)
**Icon labels should be visible at all times**, without any interaction from the user. For navigation icons, labels are particularly critical. Don’t rely on hover to reveal text labels: not only does it increase the [interaction cost](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/), but it also fails to translate well on touch devices.

The website Usability.gov uses navigation icons for _Methods_, _Templates and Documents_, and _Guidelines_ on every page within the site. If I asked each person reading this article to send me an icon that represented _Methods_, I am sure I would receive a wide variety of designs. As we stated as part of our [design guidelines for homepage usability](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/113-design-guidelines-homepage-usability/) years ago, “if you find you need to ponder to come up with an icon for navigation, chances are it’s not going to be easily recognizable or intuitive for users.” While the mobile version of the site recognizes that text labels need to accompany the icons to impart some meaning, the desktop version hides these labels until the curious user decides to hover over them. Fixing these navigational items to the left side of the page in order to remain available to users when they scroll indicates that the organization believes them to be important and useful. However, stripping these icons of text labels renders them completely meaningless and is counterproductive to the goal of providing easy access to content.
