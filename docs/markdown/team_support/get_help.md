We are always happy to help answer questions regarding Gestalt component design and usage, design system best practices, accessibility, icons and colors. If it’s part of Gestalt, we’re here to help! If it’s outside of the realm of our design system, we’ll try our best to answer and/or point you to the person who can. Feel free to [reach out on Slack](https://pinch.pinadmin.com/gestaltSlackDesign) anytime. 

## Resources, Slack, and meetings — oh my!
### Dashboards, Jira, and OKRs

If you’re curious what we’re working on, you can check out our [Gestalt sprint dashboard](https://pinch.pinadmin.com/gestaltSprint), our [full backlog](https://pinch.pinadmin.com/gestaltBacklog), and our Bugs Dashboard. To see the bigger picture, you can view our [OKRs](https://pinch.pinadmin.com/gestaltOKR) to understand our roadmap and priorities for each quarter. 

### Slack channels

Before reaching out, take a look at our [documentation](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/) to see if it answers your question, because it will likely get you the fastest answer. Still need help? Try searching Slack for your question, and then feel free to ask if your question hasn’t been answered in the past. You can also reference our [Communication guidelines](https://pinch.pinadmin.com/gestaltCommsGuidelines) for more info.

### Meetings and events
Our meetings, events, and timelines can be found on the [Gestalt event calendar](https://pinch.pinadmin.com/gestaltCalendar). We offer two different meetings for the community to bring questions, comments, ideas, and feedback:

1. **Gestalt Office Hours**

    _Purpose_
      For product designers seeking feedback on their usage of design systems and visual language. This is also a great time to propose new components or component changes.

    _Audience_
      Primarily designers, though engineers are welcome if there are technical concerns as well.

    _Cadence_
      Twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Please [sign up](https://pinch.pinadmin.com/gestaltSignUp) for a half-hour slot with your discussion topic.

2.  **Gestalt Open Forum**

    _Purpose_
      For systems designers seeking feedback from the larger design org and everything else design system related.

    _Audience_
      Pinterest designers and Gestalt engineers. The agenda for the open forum can be found in the recurring calendar invite. Please continue to bring component work to Office Hours.
      
    _Cadence_
      Every two months or as part of the Design Ops brunch & learn event. Check out through the link in the [Gestalt event calendar](https://pinch.pinadmin.com/gestaltCalendar).

3.  **Design systems day**

    _Purpose_
      Support designers, engineers, and cross-functional partners to take advantage of Gestalt Design System and reinforce components adoption and design quality standards.

    _Audience_
      Designers, engineers, and cross-functional partners.
      
    _Cadence_
      Yearly, usually in Q3. Stay tuned on #gestalt-design for information and schedule.
