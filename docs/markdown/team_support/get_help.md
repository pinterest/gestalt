We are always happy to help answer questions regarding Gestalt component design and usage, design system best practices, accessibility, icons and colors. If it’s part of Gestalt, we’re here to help! If it’s outside of the realm of our design system, we’ll try our best to answer and/or point you to the person who can.

      Primarily designers, though engineers are welcome if there are technical concerns as well.
