We suggest using Figma branches when collaborating on Gestalt design projects. For example, adding a new component or variant or modifying a Gestalt style or pattern.  
Branches enable designers to safely try new ideas without changing the main or existing Gestalt file. Rather than auto-saving to the main file, changes from branches are merged into the main file when they are ready to go.

Check out this [Figma guide to branching](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063144053-Guide-to-branching) to learn all about creating branches. 

## Naming a branch

Branch names should follow the format: designer initials-Jira ticket number-brief description of change or task. 
We use dashes to separate the words (e.g., **CR-4536-IconButton-android-specs**,  CR stands for Cintia Romero) .

The initials and Jira ticket name will support with context of the task and how it relates to our roadmap.If there isn't a ticket number available, it should be: designer initials-brief description of change or task
(e.g.,**CR-fixing-Badge-color**)

## Requesting a Gestalt review

When your new branch is ready for review, we ask you to follow the process below:

- Add 2 designers form the Gestalt team as reviewers. A primary, and a secondary reviewer
- If relevant, add a designer from the design feature team
- Add the description of your work, such as the objective of your design and any relevant highlights

### Aproval criteria
Reviewers will approve the branch after it meets the criteria below:

- Taxonomy for component is consistent for all platforms it effects
- All naming convention criteria listed above have been met
- All Gestalt styles are linked corrected (text, colors, shadows)
- There are no remote styles conflicting with Gestalt styles
- There are no accessibility concerns on the design
- Included annotations and flow assets are connected to the Handoff Kit library

### Gestalt reviewers
When requesting a branch review, prioritize as the "primary reviewer" the person with expertise in the area you need approval. See below the team members and their primary areas of expertise: 

- **Cintia Romero**: Components Figma structure, colors and themes 
- **Hector Jaime**: m10n components, data visualization, messaging/notifications and patterns
- **Layla Leal**: Product Surfaces matters
- **Kate Halvorsen**: Mobile components and illustrations
- **P.J. Onori**: XFN branch collaboration and any situation not listed in the above 4 bullets
- **Ravi Lingineni**: Plugins and any situation not listed in the above 5 bullets
<br/>
**Please note:** Any other Gestalt designer could be added as a secondary reviewer.
