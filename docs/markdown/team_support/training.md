Gestalt offers specific training for designers and cross-functional partners to advance their knowledge of Pinterest's Design System: Gestalt—fundamentals and workshops on relevant topics to reinforce systems mindset and design quality.

## Intro to Gestalt

All new design hires spend their first week learning the Pinterest ropes in Pintro, our company-wide onboarding program run by Learning & Development. It includes the Intro to Gestalt Design Systems, held monthly, every 3rd Wednesdays (1pm PST time). Designer managers should add new hires to the Intro to Gestalt Design System class. If you are a new designer hire and didn't get an invite, make sure to chat with your manager. 

You can also find the event by looking at the Pinterest design calendar.
