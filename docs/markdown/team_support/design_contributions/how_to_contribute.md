## Before submitting a contribution
- To speed up the process, check that you have a [valid design contribution](team_support/design_contributions/about_design_contributions#Types_of_valid_component_contributions).
- This isn’t required, but, if you are feeling up to it, place your contribution in a starter template in our [Contribution staging Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/d8wqI2ogUtq9tl3OGfl4bK/Staging---Component-contributions?type=design&node-id=12-4910&mode=design&t=66MCS6vhDwkHSySC-11).

## Submit via Slack
Once ready, design contributions for our Figma component libraries can be submitted via the Gestalt Design Contribution Form in the #gestalt-design Slack channel.

**Pro tip:** You can also start a contribution submission from anywhere in Slack by typing the commands **/contribution** or **/gestalt** in a message box.

## What happens after submitting?

**A bird’s eye view of the review process after submission.**

## Gestalt review process

After a contribution is submitted, a Gestalt Designer On-Call will review the contribution and get back to a contributor within 48 hours to notify them of an initial approval, rejection‌ or need for more information.

## Approved contributions get moved to in-process
Once a design is reviewed and approved to move forward, the Gestalt Team will:
1. Create a branch in the corresponding Gestalt component Figma library
2. Contributions will be tagged as “compliant”, to separate from the “certified” ones
3. Gestalt will make sure the contribution is set up with proper auto-layout features and is formatted per the library’s standards
4. Gestalt design will review the contribution internally
5. The submitting team will review and test the contribution and make sure it works
6. Gestalt will publish the contribution for general release
7. Gestalt will make a plan for certifying a contribution in the future

This will generally be handled in 1–2 design sprints, depending on the urgency of the contribution.

## Rejected contributions
If Gestalt decides that a contribution isn’t valid after review with other designers, teams‌ can escalate the decision if they feel that the design should go into the system. Note that if all teams follow our principles and visual design standards, it should be pretty rare that something has to be escalated.
