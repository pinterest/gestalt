**Note: Design contributions can only be made by Pinterest employees at the moment.**

## How to submit a contribution

Submit in Slack via our [Design Contribution form](https://slack.com/shortcuts/Ft06K9MPEB4Y/15fb6c55aa6d6e198996aafb3c9df283). For further information, go to [Submit via Slack](team_support/design_contributions/how_to_contribute#Submit-via-Slack).

## What is a design contribution?

A design contribution is any design proposal that's approved for compliant release through the Gestalt Design System for other teams to reuse. For detailed information about what makes a contribution compliant, go to [About design contributions](team_support/design_contributions/about_design_contributions).

## Contributions that are accepted

To help designers adopt our Figma components, we're mainly accepting designs that can become reusable components in our Figma library. They don't have to be scheduled for engineering implementationâ€”an engineering contribution model is in the works. Stay tuned!

## The high-level process

The contribution process is simple: 
- Designer discovers a valid use case
- Designer submits contribution form
- Gestalt on-call designer reviews request and approves if it's a valid contribution
- Gestalt co-designs with the submitter, using design checklists, component best practices and templates
- Review and approval from all parties
- Published to the Gestalt Figma library

For further information, go to [How to contribute](team_support/design_contributions/how_to_contribute).

## Contribution timeline
Review and acceptance of a contribution request takes about 48 hours. Full approval and completion of a contribution typically takes one month, depending on its urgency and complexity.

## Is there a self-service option?
Yes! If you are up for it, 
1. Go to our Figma [Contribution staging file](https://www.figma.com/file/d8wqI2ogUtq9tl3OGfl4bK/Staging---Component-contributions?type=design&node-id=12-4910&mode=design&t=66MCS6vhDwkHSySC-11) file in Figma
2. Copy a template
3. Place your contribution there in a way that can be more easily and quickly moved into our Figma libraries.
4. Submit the link from the staging Figma via the Slack contribution form
