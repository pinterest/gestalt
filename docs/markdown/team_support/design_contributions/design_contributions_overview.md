## Quick-start guide

### One step to contribute

- One step to get started: **[complete the intake form](http://pinch.pinadmin.com/design-contribution-form)**
- All you need is a Figma link for your design—your contribution doesn't need to be finalized or componentized. You’ll have a chance to answer “how done is this design” when submitting. For further tips on getting your design closer to completion, go to [Contribution types and criteria](team_support/design_contributions/contribution_types_and_criteria)
<br/>

### What happens next?

1. Your form responses are automatically posted in [#gestalt-design](http://pinch.pinadmin.com/gestalt-design) as a thread to discuss your request with the Gestalt Team
2. A Gestalt On-Call designer reviews your request and responds within two business days
3. Gestalt designers co-design with the submitter, using validation checklists, component best practices and Figma templates
4. Approval with all parties
5. Published to the Gestalt Figma library as a compliant component
